# Desktop shadcn migration record

This record owns the reproducible baseline, architecture decision, legacy inventory, and issue
sequence for M7. The product acceptance contract remains in
[`desktop-ux-audit.md`](desktop-ux-audit.md); this file records the migration evidence needed to
apply it.

## Locked foundation

| Decision            | M7 contract                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Registry            | Official `@shadcn` registry only                                                           |
| Component base      | Base UI                                                                                    |
| Style               | Nova (`base-nova` in `components.json`)                                                    |
| Icons               | Lucide; decorative icons are hidden and action icons retain accessible names               |
| Font                | Geist Variable for the renderer heading and sans contracts                                 |
| Styling             | Tailwind CSS 4 with CSS variables and semantic Cortana tokens                              |
| Generated UI alias  | `@/components/shadcn`                                                                      |
| Utilities and hooks | `@/lib`, `@/lib/utils`, and `@/hooks`                                                      |
| Renderer            | One production shadcn renderer; no build flag, query override, or packaged legacy fallback |

Generated registry components live under `components/shadcn`. Product composition imports them
directly or through the bounded `components/cortana` compositions; the temporary legacy Button,
renderer resolver, duplicate renderer entries, and runtime surface adapters have been removed.
`scripts/check-web-ui-contract.mjs` prevents those contracts and ordinary raw form controls from
returning outside the documented graph, root-failure, and generated-component exceptions.

All twelve Cortana themes map the same semantic variables. `background`, `foreground`, `card`,
`popover`, `primary`, `secondary`, `muted`, `accent`, `destructive`, `border`, `input`, `ring`,
chart, and sidebar tokens resolve through the existing theme palette. Theme selection changes
values only; component structure and interaction do not fork.

## Reproducible visual baseline

The fixture is the non-secret `?demo=1` dataset in `apps/web/src/demo.ts`. It uses `example.test`
URLs, invented people and channels, and no local paths or credentials.

From a checkout with dependencies installed:

```sh
bun run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
bun scripts/capture-m7-visuals.mjs \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:4173 \
  --output artifacts/m7-shadcn/final
bun run build
bun run --cwd apps/web preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174
bun scripts/capture-m7-visuals.mjs \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:4174 \
  --output artifacts/m7-shadcn/final-production
```

The preview command is the final production evidence source and bundles Geist locally. The pull
request workflow may use Vite development mode because its clean Linux install resolves font assets
inside the checkout; local Bun cache symlinks on macOS can otherwise produce a dev-only font 403 that
does not exist in the production build.

Install the matching browser once with `bunx playwright install chromium` when Playwright reports
that it is missing. The capture fails on browser console errors. The legacy run records 56 images:
all primary wide-screen destinations; the default and accessibility themes at 320, 768, 1024,
and 1440 CSS pixels; Forest and Plum at compact and desktop widths; command, source-sheet,
settings, and graph states. The final run records the complete matrix: the real data-backed shell
at five widths from 320 through 1920 CSS pixels in all twelve themes, mobile navigation, tablet
source/context panels, command and
workspace overlays, collapsed and expanded desktop navigation, Inbox, Conversations, Agent tools,
Index, and Help at every target width,
Settings at every target width, and populated
answer, evidence, timeline, canonical-document, and bounded-graph views, with populated
conversations at mobile and desktop widths. Its non-secret typed Desktop fixture also records
readiness, services/recovery, source-type selection, a configured source, a destructive AlertDialog,
write-only agent access, updater, query-model selection, memory controls, and backup/runtime recovery
surfaces. It additionally records configured Settings at every target width and theme plus explicit
first-run, busy, success, warning, failure, cancellation, retry, and recovery states. Fixture paths
use `/example` and no secret value is present in the DOM or screenshots.

`.github/workflows/m7-visual-evidence.yml` runs the same capture on the exact pull-request revision,
audits every final-renderer theme/width against WCAG 2.2 AA automation, and uploads the complete
non-secret matrix as a 30-day GitHub Actions artifact. Link the exact run from the issue or pull
request; local artifact paths alone are not acceptance evidence. Final packaged evidence uses the
longer-lived release record required by the Desktop UX audit.

The automated interaction gate also verifies keyboard-opened mobile navigation and focus return,
the command palette, workspace and action menus, source-panel reachability, reduced-motion Sheet
behavior, and a 720-CSS-pixel layout at 2x density as the reflow equivalent of a
1,440-physical-pixel window at 200% zoom. Issue #2168 retains the real packaged 200% zoom and
assistive-technology checks.

The baseline exposed acceptance failures that the final renderer corrects:

- the primary navigation is absent below 781 CSS pixels, leaving Settings, Help, Inbox, Graph,
  Memory, and Agent tools unreachable;
- the 320-pixel title bar clips the Reflect action and the status bar overflows horizontally;
- the web fixture cannot render populated Desktop settings, setup, service, recovery, backup, or
  update states, so M7 must add deterministic typed native-bridge fixtures before final evidence;
- the command surface manually implements modal semantics and focus instead of using the shared
  overlay primitives;
- similarly named Conversations actions make broad accessible-name selectors ambiguous;
- custom breakpoint and selector families duplicate component behavior across files.

## Baseline measurements

Measurements were captured on the deterministic Vite development fixture on 2026-08-26. They are
diagnostic comparison points, not packaged performance claims.

| Measurement                          |  Legacy baseline | Foundation prototype |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------: | -------------------: |
| Median DOM content loaded, five runs |           340 ms |               323 ms |
| Median load event, five runs         |           342 ms |               325 ms |
| Median network-idle ready, five runs |           961 ms |             1,069 ms |
| Median Chromium JS heap used         | 16,973,928 bytes |     19,736,116 bytes |
| DOM nodes                            |              535 |                  328 |
| Layout count                         |                4 |                    5 |

The pre-migration production build transformed 1,699 modules in 1.55 seconds. Its renderer entry
was 453,729 bytes (133.57 kB gzip), and legacy CSS was 72,299 bytes (13.67 kB gzip). The flag-disabled
foundation build keeps the shadcn prototype in separate lazy chunks: the complete legacy-default
initial graph is 455.07 kB, while the prototype is 206.05 kB (66.58 kB gzip) plus the complete
shared primitive CSS contract at 121.35 kB (18.83 kB gzip). Issue #2167 must compare the final
single renderer to the baseline and remove transition-only
code before issue #2168 can accept performance.

`bun run build` walks the Vite manifest recursively and enforces final single-renderer budgets:
800,000 bytes for the application entry and its initial static graph, 960,000 bytes for the full
production JavaScript graph excluding the demo-only fixture, and 220,000 bytes for application CSS.
The #2167 cleanup measurement is 788,156 bytes initial JavaScript, 933,738 bytes complete production
JavaScript, and 208,515 bytes CSS before minifier hash variation. These are uncompressed review
ceilings, not performance claims; recursive measurement prevents manual chunking from hiding
imports. The earlier transition measurements remain the historical comparison above.

The reviewed M10 build measures 799,339 bytes of initial JavaScript, 955,954 bytes of complete
production JavaScript, and 217,515 bytes of CSS. The initial ceiling remains unchanged: the bounded
graph response validator is loaded only when graph data is requested. The narrowly expanded total
and CSS ceilings account for the optional vault-management surface, graph provenance and filter
controls, and accessible loading/error states while continuing to fail unbounded production growth.

The added JavaScript packages use MIT or Apache-2.0 licenses. The bundled Geist font package uses
OFL-1.1. No copyleft runtime, native library, hosted font request, or new executable is introduced.
`bun audit --production` reports no known vulnerabilities after pinning the remediated transitive
`js-yaml` and `nanoid` releases in `bun.lock`.

## Shared primitive contract

Issue #2162 installs the source-owned form, data, feedback, and interaction families required by
the migration: Button, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Slider, Select, Combobox
composition, Toggle/ToggleGroup, InputGroup, Field/FieldSet, Card, Table, Badge, Avatar, Alert,
Empty, Skeleton, Spinner, Progress, Separator, toast, Accordion, Collapsible, Resizable,
Pagination, ContextMenu, and HoverCard. Generated registry components remain unmodified except for
the reviewed semantic overlay and mobile-sidebar accessibility fixes recorded above.

The approved composed contracts live under `components/cortana`: `AsyncButton` owns busy and
disabled semantics, `ValidatedInput` owns label/help/error association, `StatusBadge` owns busy,
offline, success, warning, and error tones, and `FeedbackState` owns loading, empty, success,
warning, error, and retry presentation. Primary, secondary, outline, ghost, link, destructive,
compact, icon, busy, disabled, and validation behavior is expressed through generated variants,
sizes, and these compositions rather than page-local classes. Ordinary icon-only actions use the
generated icon sizes and always require an accessible name at the call site.

## Legacy control and CSS inventory

The final production source has no temporary Button, raw input, raw select, or raw textarea outside
generated shadcn components. Two raw button exceptions remain: the root chunk-failure recovery
control, which must work before shared chunks load, and the custom graph node canvas. The generated
Sidebar retains its registry-owned native trigger. Static enforcement verifies these exact
exceptions.

The migration began with this 5,087-line stylesheet contract:

| Owner                   | Lines | Current responsibility                                    | Replacement                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----: | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `styles/tokens.css`     |   354 | Twelve themes, type, focus, control sizes, reduced motion | semantic variables in `shadcn.css`; #2161 and #2167                  |
| `styles/buttons.css`    |    97 | temporary `cortana-button` variants                       | generated Button variants; #2162 and #2167                           |
| `styles/shell.css`      | 1,068 | title bar, rail, panes, status, overlays                  | Sidebar, Sheet, Tooltip, Command, shell composition; #2163 and #2164 |
| `styles/workspace.css`  |   809 | document, answer, graph, timeline, tabs                   | Card, Tabs, ScrollArea, Empty, Skeleton, renderer wrapper; #2165     |
| `styles/context.css`    |   159 | agent-context pane                                        | Card, Sheet, Badge, Progress; #2165                                  |
| `styles/settings.css`   | 1,927 | setup, sources, forms, services, updates                  | Field system and shared feedback/overlays; #2162 and #2166           |
| `styles/utility.css`    |   470 | inbox, conversations, agent tools, memory                 | shared cards, tables, status, menus; #2165 and #2166                 |
| `styles/responsive.css` |   203 | 1280, 1000, and 780 pixel shell forks                     | component-owned responsive composition; #2164 through #2167          |

Additional page-local breakpoints exist at 760, 780, and 900 pixels. The final renderer may retain
layout breakpoints, but it must not retain a second component styling or interaction system.

## Surface inventory and execution sequence

The graph canvas, virtualized document list, native title-bar integration, and native file/dialog
launch points remain explicit renderer exceptions. Their controls, surrounding surfaces, status,
focus, and theme behavior still use shared shadcn composition. No M7 work changes Tauri capabilities,
native commands, source approval, credential handling, retrieval behavior, or stored data.

## Knowledge workspace migration

Issue #2165 keeps retrieval, ACL, pagination, cancellation, virtualization, and graph traversal in
the existing data owners while replacing their presentation boundary with shadcn. The live renderer
uses shared Tabs, Button, Input, Select, Toggle, Card, Badge, Empty, ScrollArea, and Textarea
primitives across workspace navigation and feedback, source and document navigation, the context
inspector, bounded graph controls, and native-memory review. There is no alternate renderer or
rollback flag.

The canonical document body, radial graph canvas, and virtualized list math remain purpose-built.
Their interactive rows, filters, pagination, status, selected-node inspector, theme colors, and
responsive boundaries are shadcn-owned. This preserves stable document provenance and bounded graph
loading without disguising custom renderers as ordinary component primitives.

## Settings and operations migration

Issue #2166 routes settings text fields, textareas, checkboxes, switches, radio budgets, selects,
buttons, cards, alerts, workspace/source tabs, advanced disclosures, destructive confirmations,
and the toast host through generated shadcn primitives. `SettingsSurface.tsx` exposes the shared
composition directly; the model Combobox and provider-secret InputGroup remain lazy workflow
modules. Section navigation intentionally mounts only the active workflow, and the complete
Settings view, source workflow, advanced workflow, Combobox, and InputGroup are split from the
initial application bundle. `SettingsConfirm.tsx` owns the shared AlertDialog promise boundary and
restores focus to the initiating action after Cancel, Escape, or Continue.

Settings layout and validation association now live in `SettingsLayout.tsx`; portable settings,
secret-file access, and secure-storage migration live in `AdvancedSettingsSection.tsx`. The
generated FieldLabel, FieldDescription, and FieldError contract gives numeric fields deterministic
required, whole-number, and range errors, then restores the last saved value when an invalid draft
loses focus. The source workflow lives in `SourceSettingsWorkflow.tsx`, keeping the settings
controller focused on persistence and cross-workflow state rather than one oversized component. The
controller keeps write-only secret drafts separate from the persisted settings object, removes a
pending clear when a replacement value is entered, and prunes drafts when a credential identity is
renamed or removed. Principal, workspace, source, and stored-credential removal are explicit draft
confirmations; native service, backup/restore, installer, authorization, validation, trial-sync,
initial-sync, updater, import, and secure-storage safety messages retain their previous bounded
semantics.

The deterministic Desktop settings fixture in `apps/web/src/demoDesktop.ts` exists only behind
`?demo=1`. It contains invented
identities, `example.test` URLs, masked `/example` paths, configuration metadata, and configured
secret indicators without secret values. It lets the visual evidence job exercise real Settings
composition in a browser without adding Tauri capabilities, invoking native commands, or exposing
host state. The issue #2166 evidence set covered the configured matrix and explicit setup, busy,
success, warning, failure, cancelled, retry, and recovery states; the current capture gate
(`scripts/capture-m7-visuals.mjs`) produces more than 120 screenshots per run — 60 shell
combinations across the theme and viewport matrix plus targeted knowledge, settings,
navigation, and state captures — each with an axe WCAG audit.

## shadcn lint enforcement

`@shadcn/lint` runs inside the shared Oxlint pass (`.oxlintrc.json`, `bun run lint`) with all six
rules at error severity: `no-restyle`, `no-raw-colors`, `no-arbitrary-values`, `no-inline-styles`,
`no-unknown-classes`, and `require-static-classes`.

- Application classes defined in `apps/web/src/shadcn.css` are allowlisted per rule; add new
  project class prefixes to the matching `allow` globs when introducing them.
- Generated components under `apps/web/src/components/shadcn/**` form the primitive boundary and
  carry a scoped override so registry code can import Base UI and restyle freely. Application code
  must reach primitives only through that directory: `eslint/no-restricted-imports` rejects direct
  `@base-ui/*`, `@radix-ui/*`, and `radix-*` imports elsewhere.
- `RendererErrorBoundary` keeps inline styles deliberately because it renders before the CSS
  bundle loads; `shadcn/no-inline-styles` is off for that file only.
- Synchronous `setState` inside effects is a warning (`react/set-state-in-effect`): prefer
  render-time adjustment for prop-driven resets, and use a documented `oxlint-disable` comment
  only for reconciliation effects that also perform side effects.
