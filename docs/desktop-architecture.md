# Desktop architecture

Cortana Desktop is a Tauri 2 control plane over the independently managed Cortana runtime. The
runtime remains useful to MCP clients and other agents when the desktop window is closed.

## Trust boundary

The webview cannot invoke an arbitrary process, read an arbitrary file, or choose a backend URL.
Its only native data path is a small set of typed Tauri commands. Those commands call the fixed
owner-local endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:7331`, reject unknown request fields, and bound all query
and scope inputs before forwarding them.

The default capability grants only:

- core window/event functionality;
- autostart enable, disable, and status;
- a desktop-process restart for applying an update;
- updater checks and installation.

The matching core executable is bundled as a Tauri sidecar for each release target. Native Rust
code may invoke only that declared sidecar; the webview receives no shell capability and cannot
replace its path or arguments. The sidecar is included inside the updater-signed desktop artifact,
so Desktop readiness never depends on a separately downloaded Cortana executable. Each artifact also
contains the connector package source (without credentials or a venv) as a private Tauri resource;
the native installer can use that fixed resource to create the user's connector environment locally.
If the bundled sidecar is missing or cannot be started, readiness fails closed and asks the user to
reinstall the matching Desktop release; it never falls back to a `cortana` executable found on
`PATH`.

Secrets and source credentials remain outside the renderer. The settings bridge returns only
configured/unset metadata and accepts write-only named secret updates. It refuses symlinked config
or secret files, externally managed secret paths, insecure remote HTTP endpoints, malformed TOML
sections, broad data roots, and unbounded inputs. Desktop can explicitly migrate referenced values
from its owner-only `secrets.env` into the platform credential store (macOS Keychain, Windows
Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service); the migration verifies each write, removes only the
managed file values, records no secret in audit data, and rolls back native writes on publication
failure. Environment-backed and externally managed private-file paths remain available to the
headless runtime and are never silently migrated. File/config writes are atomic, the previous
config has a rollback copy, and all operational events are metadata-only.

The renderer can edit typed provider, cache, timeout, ingestion-budget, workspace, and storage
fields. It cannot edit connector command arrays or service commands because those fields cross
directly into process execution. Source authorization and service control use separate typed
native commands.

Corpus browsing also stays behind typed native commands. The renderer may send only bounded
project/source filters, an opaque pagination cursor, or a hex document ID. Native Rust constructs
the fixed loopback URLs and performs the request; the renderer cannot select a host, port, path, or
database file. Original `file:` links take a second native path: the target is canonicalized and
must remain inside a configured filesystem source root, so symlinks cannot escape the indexed
scope. Other external links use a fixed scheme allowlist; Slack, Apple Notes, and Buzz deep links
are accepted only when they match their exact host/path/query shape, with no credentials or
arbitrary query fields.
The core API applies the same bearer scope and document ACL policy as retrieval, bounds
pages to 100 summaries and content to 2 MiB, and records metadata-only list/read audits.

Readiness is user-triggered and read-only. It performs bounded version checks for uv and Python
3.11+, locates the managed connector environment and the configured local embedding runtime, and
runs `cortana readiness` through the bundled sidecar. A local embedding provider makes the
`text-embeddings-router` runtime a required readiness component; on macOS with Homebrew available,
Desktop offers a fixed, approval-gated `text-embeddings-inference` install. The model weights are
still downloaded only when the embedding service first starts. Cloud embedding providers do not
require the local runtime. It rejects oversized or malformed reports and never starts a connector or sync. The
desktop shell retains the latest snapshot and scan activity across Settings navigation; successful
installer completion schedules one shell-owned follow-up scan so readiness reflects the installed
state even when the Settings view is not mounted.

When the core report exposes a stored embedding generation that differs from the configured
fingerprint, Settings shows an explicit confirmation-gated **Adopt stored generation** action. The
native command passes only the exact reported fingerprint to `cortana migrate-embedding`; the CLI
takes the sync lock, verifies and backs up SQLite, clears derived caches, and leaves indexed
documents untouched. Operators must use it only after confirming that the model, dimension, and
vector space are interchangeable; a true model change still requires a new generation rebuild.

Tool installation is a second native boundary. The renderer can request only a fixed tool ID and
must set an explicit approval flag after showing a confirmation. Native code maps that ID to a
platform-specific command, permits one job at a time, bounds and sanitizes returned logs, supports
cancellation, and writes metadata-only audit events beside the active Cortana config. The `connectors`
plan is a fixed two-step uv invocation against the signed bundle resource and the per-user venv;
on success, the native boundary records the fixed installed connector path in the managed config
when no connector command is configured (and preserves an existing command), with a rollback copy
and metadata-only audit event. Arbitrary programs, package sources, and arguments are never
accepted from the renderer. Installer commands run in an isolated process group on Unix so
cancellation also terminates shell and package-manager helpers.

On Desktop startup, the native setup hook compares the managed connector environment with the
bundled connector release and automatically starts that same fixed installer when the environment
is missing or stale. The readiness surface reports this as automatic reconciliation in progress;
users do not need to rediscover or manually reinstall the Connector Environment after each Desktop
update. A failed reconciliation remains visible as a readiness failure for recovery.

Source validation is a third native boundary. The renderer sends only an exact configured source
name. Native Rust reloads the owner-local configuration, rejects an unknown name, then constructs
the declared sidecar command with fixed `validate-source` arguments and limits of 25 documents,
5 MiB, and 60 seconds. Filesystem sources additionally receive `--sample` so a root larger than
the budget records a bounded partial validation instead of failing; the persisted record carries a
completeness marker, and only complete validations can bless full-corpus syncs. Only one
validation runs at a time; progress is bounded, sanitized, and
cancellable. The command cannot start sync, embedding, indexing, or reconciliation, and its
metadata-only lifecycle is appended to the Desktop audit log. The same command can optionally
validate at one of the fixed initial-sync budget tiers so a later validation-gated initial sync
has a record at equal or larger limits; validation stays read-only and bounded in every tier.
Desktop-launched source jobs run in an isolated process group, so cancellation terminates the
bundled wrapper and any connector helpers together instead of leaving an orphaned fetch process.
While a source job is active, Desktop locks that source's identity, credentials, scope, and
per-source limits so the operation cannot race a settings edit. The status bar and Inbox expose
the bounded progress snapshot and a cancellation control without requiring the Settings view to
remain open. Terminal jobs retain a collapsed, bounded sanitized log in Inbox so an operator can
diagnose a failed connector without leaving the activity surface. The native job state exposes a
bounded history snapshot on renderer startup, so a
webview remount recovers active and recent jobs instead of losing operational visibility; the
Sources settings section adopts the newest recovered snapshot so an operator can cancel or retry
it after navigating back. A failed recovery request is non-fatal and newly started jobs remain
tracked locally.

Desktop also exposes a separate **Check connection** source job. It uses the fixed
`cortana check-source SOURCE_NAME` command, which verifies a filesystem root or external command
configuration directly and runs connector sources with a one-document, cache-free reachability
probe. It does not parse documents into the index, write embeddings, reconcile records, or create
validation coverage. The action is therefore safe for a quick credential/connection check; use
budget validation when the goal is to prove that a later bounded sync is covered.

Guarded trial sync reuses the source-job boundary but is intentionally distinct from validation.
It requires explicit confirmation and a matching successful validation fingerprint, then invokes
only the fixed `sync --source NAME --require-validation --no-reconcile` shape with limits of 25
documents, 5 MiB, and five minutes. It may write embeddings and documents, so the UI and audit
record say so explicitly. It cannot reconcile deletions, expand its limits, select multiple
sources, or install a recurring sync job.

Guided initial sync is the next tier of the same source-job boundary and stays a two-step native
protocol. The renderer sends only a configured source name, one of three fixed budget enum values
(100 documents/25 MiB/15 minutes, 500/64 MiB/30 minutes, or 2,000/128 MiB/60 minutes), and a
plan/execute operation; it can never supply CLI flags, raw numbers, or credentials. A plan
request is read-only: native Rust resolves the saved source, returns the exact budget limits that
execution will enforce, reports whether the latest validation record covers that budget and
whether that validation was complete or a bounded sample, and
issues a short-lived one-shot plan id. Execution requires that plan id plus an explicit approval,
an enabled source, and a successful validation record at equal or larger limits; it then runs the
fixed `sync --source NAME --require-validation --no-reconcile --max-documents N --max-bytes B
--max-seconds S` shape for the selected tier. It reuses the existing single-job lock,
cancellation, bounded sanitized logs, and metadata-only audit lifecycle (including the selected
budget tier), and it never silently escalates beyond the chosen tier. The sidecar's own
`--require-validation` gate remains authoritative even if the Desktop-side coverage hint is
stale or missing.

Source authorization and setup are separate fixed native boundaries. For Google sources, the
renderer can request authorization only for an exact saved source with an absolute token
destination (the `token` field or the path held by `token_env`) and Desktop OAuth client path. Native Rust invokes the bundled sidecar with the fixed
`authorize-google SOURCE` shape. The sidecar uses Authorization Code + PKCE, a random loopback
port and state value, fixed HTTPS Google endpoints, bounded callback and token-exchange timeouts,
minimum read-only scopes, and owner-only atomic token writes. GitHub sources use the analogous
`authorize-github SOURCE` device flow with a supplied client-id JSON and owner-only token file.
Tokens and authorization codes never enter renderer state, logs, command output, or audit records.

Provider setup links are selected by native code from a fixed allowlist and opened in the system
browser; the renderer cannot supply a URL. File and folder selection also stays native. The
renderer requests one of four fixed picker kinds: source directory, OAuth client JSON, Google
token destination, or GitHub token destination. It receives a validated absolute path and has no
general filesystem permission.

## Web UI component strategy

The Desktop webview reuses the SolidJS/Vite app in `apps/web`. It consumes the published
`@adea-ai/ui` and `@adea-ai/themes` packages for shared components and themes. At this source
revision, their exact versions are pinned in the manifests and `bun.lock`; the current component,
theme, styling, and consumer-validation contract lives in [Web UI standards](web-ui-standards.md).

The shared UI package owns accessible controls, compound components, component visuals, fonts,
typography, spacing variants, and shared semantic tokens. The theme package owns the published
palette catalogue and provenance. Cortana owns domain screens and behavior for its sources,
documents, graph, memory, and operations. App CSS may arrange domain content using shared tokens,
but it does not redefine theme tokens or restyle shared controls. Workspace theme selection uses
variants from the shared catalogue without forking component markup or interaction behavior.

Renderer-specific domain surfaces such as the graph canvas, virtualized document list, and native
title-bar integration may use custom rendering where no shared component fits. Their controls,
loading and error states, menus, overlays, typography, focus behavior, and responsive layout still
follow the shared consumer contract. The typed native-command boundary, Tauri capability set,
credential handling, and source and service approval gates remain independent of that component
ownership.

Web UI validation requirements are maintained in [Web UI standards](web-ui-standards.md).
Packaged interaction and operating-system acceptance evidence remains governed by the
[Desktop UX audit](desktop-ux-audit.md); a source build alone is not packaged-product evidence.

## Workspaces and settings

Workspace and principal mappings follow the [identity contract](contracts/identity.md). UI selection
never grants authorization; the Rust runtime remains the authority for project and ACL checks.

Workspaces are query/project scopes inside one canonical database, rather than separate indexes.
This keeps embedding and query caches reusable while allowing agents and people to filter work,
personal, or special context. Desktop permits one to four workspaces; the
storage and API contract remain list-based so that limit can be raised without a data migration.

Workspace metadata is exposed by `/v1/status`. Desktop search sends the selected workspace ID as
the existing project scope, and source navigation plus canonical document pagination filter to
that scope. The sidebar groups paginated documents under workspace and source nodes; selecting a
document opens canonical content rather than a retrieved chunk. Editing a workspace may not orphan
a configured source: source assignments must be moved before their workspace ID can be removed.

Provider secrets default to Cortana's managed `secrets.env` file with mode `0600` on Unix. Desktop
offers an explicit, idempotent migration of referenced provider values into the platform
credential store; once the native backend marker is published, write-only updates and reads use
that store, while environment-backed headless deployments remain supported. An existing external
`runtime.env_file` remains readable by the runtime but is intentionally read-only and ineligible
for Desktop migration. When a saved source, provider, or agent reference is removed, Desktop
retires that now-unreferenced value from its managed backend while leaving external files
untouched. Advanced settings shows only the effective owner-only file path when the file backend is
active and never exposes any secret values.
Embedding settings also reports whether a local service executable is explicitly configured or
will be derived from the model and loopback endpoint; Desktop preserves explicit command arrays
but never accepts arbitrary shell commands from the renderer.

The source editor supports the native filesystem, Apple Notes, Buzz, Google Drive, Gmail, Google
Calendar, GitHub code, Slack, and Discord connector schemas. GitHub code requires an explicit
`owner/repository` allowlist and either a configured token environment variable or private token
file. The bundled runtime now supports OAuth device-flow authorization and bounded repository
discovery; the Desktop chooser consumes that typed, allowlisted boundary and persists only the
selected `owner/repository` values. It can retain, disable,
or remove an existing external command connector, but cannot create or modify command arrays.
Google token files and OAuth client files and local roots must be absolute non-root paths. Slack
requires explicit channels and a validated bot-token environment name.
Discord requires explicit channels plus private Desktop RPC token and OAuth-client paths (never an
environment variable).
Apple Notes sources can be split across workspaces with exact folder allowlists (`folders`) and
exclusions (`exclude_folders`); an empty allowlist means all folders except explicit exclusions.
The source card's **Grant Apple Notes access** action opens macOS Privacy & Security → Automation
so the operator can approve Notes control before a validation or sync trial.
The connector keeps the originating account and folder in document metadata, while the Desktop
editor exposes both lists as repeatable line-separated fields.
Canonical source
labels are unique within each workspace, must not be padded with whitespace or contain control
characters, and cannot merge connectors' indexed scope or health history. Saving or authorizing source
settings never starts ingestion. The knowledge sidebar also exposes a confirmation-gated
enable/disable switch for each saved connector; it writes only that source's enabled flag, leaves
existing indexed data untouched, and is disabled while a Settings draft is unsaved or first-launch
setup is incomplete. When status reports missing provider setup or an unauthorized Google source,
the same tree offers the fixed provider setup link or starts the bounded browser authorization job;
credentials still remain outside the renderer.

First launch enters a guided checklist and automatically runs only the read-only readiness scan.
The automatic attempt is one-shot: a failure is retained as an actionable status and waits for an
explicit operator retry instead of polling in a loop. Missing tool installers remain fixed native
jobs that require explicit approval and expose bounded progress, cancellation, and retry state.

Settings portability uses a versioned, size-bounded JSON envelope selected through the native file
dialog. Exports exclude secret values and executable connector commands. Imports reject unknown
fields, embedded-secret declarations, unsupported versions, oversized files, symlinks, and
unvalidated values. They return an unsaved preview to the renderer, preserve locally configured
external connectors, and rely on the existing owner-only backup-and-replace path only after the
user saves.

## Lifecycle

There are two distinct lifecycles:

1. The Cortana runtime owns the API, embedding service, opt-in ingestion, and backups.
2. Cortana Desktop owns the window, tray, updater, and user controls.

Closing the main window hides it. The tray continues to report runtime, corpus, bounded ingestion,
and source-job status (active work or the latest terminal attention per source). Quitting from the
tray exits only the desktop process; it does not
silently stop the runtime or start a sync. A second desktop launch focuses the existing window.
When the webview is backgrounded or loses native window focus, passive status, service, source-job,
and optional-sidecar polling pauses; the tray and long-running installer/source/update jobs continue
independently. This boundary also applies to the standalone Settings fallback observers used before
the shell has populated shared snapshots. The shell performs an immediate health refresh when the
window becomes visible or focused again, avoiding background traffic without hiding active work.

The shell and Services panel read a bounded structured report from the bundled sidecar; the shell
keeps a compact core-health indicator while the panel provides the full per-service controls. The
panel can explicitly
install the safe query-only service set (embedding when the configured provider is local, server,
and backup) through the fixed `service install --no-web` command. macOS uses per-user launchd jobs;
Linux uses per-user systemd units and timers without requiring root; Windows uses per-user Task
Scheduler tasks without administrator access. It accepts only the fixed
`embedding`, `server`, `sync`, `backup`, and `vault` IDs with `start`, `stop`, or `restart`.
Every action requires an explicit confirmation and is audited without command output or secrets.
An uninstalled sync job remains absent until the dedicated validation-gated **Enable recurring sync**
action is confirmed. Desktop
autostart is managed separately and does not change runtime-service or ingestion state. Service
commands run in an isolated process group on Unix with a bounded timeout, so a stalled install or
action also terminates bundled runtime helpers instead of leaving an orphaned process behind.
Desktop stores validated sync and backup intervals in the owner-only `service-schedule.toml` beside
the active configuration. Core and recurring installs pass those saved intervals to the bundled
runtime; changing an installed schedule surfaces a separate explicit apply action rather than
silently rewriting a running job.
The derived-vault schedule is a separate CLI opt-in with an explicit absolute destination,
workspace allowlist, and interval. Desktop exposes its status and individual controls after it is
installed, but core or recurring-sync actions never opt into it.
Each approved installer command is capped at ten minutes; a timeout is recorded as a retryable
failure with bounded, sanitized output. Service actions are serialized so a retry cannot overlap a
running action, and the latest running, succeeded, failed, or cancelled record is persisted in the
metadata-only audit log. The shell restores that bounded activity snapshot from native status and
mirrors it in the status bar, keeping an install or start/stop/restart request visible while the
operator changes sections or returns to the knowledge view; completion and sanitized failures link
back to the Services panel.
The same shell-owned boundary retains native memory status while the operator changes settings
sections. Health checks read the last saved local configuration and native memory statistics; the
Desktop never contacts a separate memory service.

Start All, Stop All, and Restart All are narrower than the individual controls: they operate only
on `embedding` and `server`, in dependency-safe order. They always exclude `sync`, `backup`, and
`vault`, so a whole-app action cannot schedule ingestion, trigger a backup, or publish a derived
vault.

Desktop manages named bearer principals without exposing credentials to the renderer. The webview
edits only principal names, environment-variable references, scopes, and ACL labels. Write-only
values go to the owner-only managed secret file. Native loopback requests resolve a matching
private credential for `query`, `status`, or `admin` immediately before sending the request. When
an admin-scoped credential also carries the requested `query` or `status` scope, the owner-local
Desktop prefers it for that request so a narrow agent principal cannot hide other workspaces from
the control plane; an admin-only credential falls back to the requested scope. Bearer values never
enter IPC responses or renderer state.

The Audit panel combines the API's bounded metadata-only retrieval events with a bounded tail of
the owner-only Desktop action log. Runtime unavailability does not prevent local action events
from being inspected. Both views exclude query text, document content, command output, and secret
values.

## Releases

Desktop Rust has its own lockfile so platform WebKit dependencies do not enter the core Rust
workspace or its reusable CI. Pull requests compile the webview and Tauri binary on Linux. Published
releases build the native installers and matching sidecars on macOS ARM64, Linux x64, and Windows
x64, then sign updater artifacts with the dedicated Tauri key.

The updater public key is part of the application configuration. Its private key and password are
GitHub Actions secrets. Local contributor builds require neither secret:

```bash
bun run desktop:build
```

Updater signing authenticates the downloaded update payload; it is distinct from operating-system
publisher trust. The macOS release job requires an Apple Developer ID certificate and either
App Store Connect API-key or Apple ID notarization credentials. It fails before release
completion when the bundle is not Developer ID signed, hardened, timestamped, Gatekeeper
assessed, and stapled. Local builds remain ad-hoc and are not supported distribution evidence.

If an existing ad-hoc macOS installation must be recovered before Apple credentials are
available, an operator may explicitly set the repository variable
`CORTANA_ALLOW_ADHOC_MACOS_RELEASE=true` and manually dispatch the release-assets workflow for
the affected tag. That emergency path still signs the updater archive with Cortana's Tauri
minisign key and keeps the strict asset/signature verifier enabled, but it skips Developer ID,
Gatekeeper, and notarization checks. It is not a trusted distribution release; remove the
variable as soon as the Apple signing secrets are configured.

The release-only secrets are `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`,
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, and either `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`,
`APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64` or `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Secret values stay in
GitHub Actions; the workflow never writes them to the repository or evidence artifacts.

Update checks, downloads, signature verification, installation, and restart requests run in native
Rust. The renderer can display version metadata, release notes, the compiled changelog, and bounded
download progress, but cannot override the feed URL, signature key, download URL, or expected
version. Installation requires explicit confirmation and verifies the announced signature before
replacing the app.
The signed download and install operation is capped at 30 minutes; a timeout preserves the
verified pending update for an explicit retry and records a metadata-only failure audit.

On macOS, an unsigned local application bundle can be produced separately:

```bash
bun run desktop:bundle:mac
```
