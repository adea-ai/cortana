# Native agentic memory

The durable taxonomy and lifecycle contract is [Native memory contract](contracts/memory.md).

Cortana is vertically integrated: the same private SQLite store owns both
source-backed knowledge and explicit agent memory. Documents and code remain
evidence; memories are small, deliberate conclusions that agents choose to
retain.

## Current release boundary

The current protected source and published package are `v0.56.13`. Native memory remains the only
supported memory engine: it is local, explicit-write, ACL-filtered, auditable, exportable, and
separate from source knowledge. External memory providers are not product dependencies.

## Memory model

Each memory has independent content and retention axes:

- `semantic` — a durable fact or relationship;
- `episodic` — an event, decision, or interaction;
- `procedural` — a repeatable workflow or preference for how work is done;
- `preference` — a stable user preference;
- `content_type` is `semantic`, `episodic`, `procedural`, or `preference`;
- `retention_tier` is `durable` or `working`;
- `scope` is `session`, `principal`, `workspace`, or `owner-global`.

`workspace` is the generally available scoped-write boundary. `owner-global`
requires an authenticated owner. `session` and `principal` are reserved contract
values and fail closed on writes until the store carries and verifies their
identity binding; an ACL label is not treated as that binding.

The legacy `kind` field remains readable and writable during the compatibility window. A
`working` kind is represented as semantic content with working retention; durable kinds project
their content type. New callers should set the independent axes when they need a non-default
combination.

Working memories may include an RFC3339 `valid_until` timestamp. Recall and answer
context automatically exclude expired records, so agents can keep short-lived task
state without a cleanup race. Durable facts should omit the expiry and be replaced
or forgotten explicitly when they change.

Every record carries independent content type, retention tier, scope, a workspace/project, ACL,
provenance, source and source id, confidence, importance, timestamps, and a lifecycle status. Writes are
idempotent when an agent supplies a `dedupe_key`. Replacements atomically mark
the previous record `superseded`; forgetting redacts content and leaves only a
minimal tombstone for auditability.

## Agent contract

Agents should retrieve evidence and matching durable memories together with
`context`; use `recall` when memory-only results are needed. The context bundle
keeps memories in a separate, clearly labelled section so agents can use
operational context without presenting it as a source citation. They should
call `remember` only for an explicit, bounded conclusion and include provenance
in the same call. Never copy an entire email, note, transcript, or code file
into memory. Use `forget` when a user withdraws a memory.

The human-facing `/v1/answer` path follows the same contract for principals with
the `memory` scope: matching native memories are returned separately and may
help the synthesizer, while only indexed evidence can satisfy numbered citation
requirements. Query-only principals receive evidence-only answers. Memory writes
advance a dedicated revision so cached answers cannot retain retracted or stale
operational context.

The native MCP tools are:

- `remember` — write one bounded memory;
- `recall` — ACL-filtered prefix-aware recall with a precise all-term pass and a bounded natural-language fallback. Candidates are ranked locally by query coverage, lexical relevance, confidence, importance, freshness, and exact-vs-fallback match using Cortana's own store;
- `forget` — redact one memory;
- `context` — retrieve cited source evidence plus relevant native memory in a
  token-bounded bundle.
- `export` — export bounded native records, including redacted tombstones, for
  an operator-controlled backup or migration.
- `propose_memory_candidate` — submit one bounded, provenance-bearing observation to the isolated
  review queue. It is not canonical memory and is not recallable until explicitly promoted.
- `list_memory_candidates` — list candidates visible to the current principal.
- `export_memory_candidates` — export a bounded, scoped candidate audit/backup view.
- `cancel_memory_candidate` / `redact_memory_candidate` — close or redact pending proposals.
- `classify_memory_candidate` — compare one visible pending candidate with same-scope canonical
  memory using deterministic local rules; this is review-only and never mutates memory.

Consolidation is a separate opt-in policy boundary. The default policy is disabled, and promotion
must use the versioned `cortana.memory.consolidation.v1` rules. Safe, non-sensitive, in-scope,
non-conflicting candidates are eligible for auto-retention only above configured confidence and
importance thresholds and after the non-deserializable runtime release gate is reviewed and
enabled. HTTP, MCP, and CLI policy input cannot set that gate; until then, eligible candidates remain
review-only. Sensitive, contradictory, low-confidence, or cross-scope candidates remain review-only.
Working retention stays bounded and cannot silently become durable. Queue entries are priority
ordered, deduplicated by candidate and policy version, retry bounded, pausable, cancellable, and
dead-lettered after repeated failures. Promotion uses the same atomic remember invariants as an
explicit write and emits metadata-only audit events. Turning consolidation off has no effect on
explicit memory or source retrieval.

The equivalent CLI is:

```sh
cortana memory remember --kind preference --project work \
  --title "Release notes" \
  --content "Prefer concise release notes with explicit risks" \
  --dedupe-key work:release-notes
cortana memory remember --kind working --project work \
  --title "Current task" --content "Validate the release" \
  --valid-until "2026-08-16T18:00:00Z"
cortana memory remember --kind semantic --content-type procedural \
  --retention-tier working --scope workspace --project work \
  --title "Current procedure" --content "Validate the release"
cortana memory recall "release notes" --project work --retention-tier durable
cortana memory export --project work --limit 10000 > work-memory.json
cortana memory forget MEMORY_ID
```

HTTP clients can use `POST /v1/memory`, `POST /v1/memory/recall`, and
`POST /v1/memory/forget`, or `GET /v1/memory/export`. Shared agents need the `memory` scope in addition to
their normal query/status scopes; ACLs are enforced before content is returned
or redacted. The remember, recall, and export contracts accept independent
`content_type`, `retention_tier`, and `scope` fields/filters; `kind` remains a
backward-compatible alias. `owner-global` requires owner authorization even
when an ACL label would otherwise match. Requests to write `session` or
`principal` scope are rejected until their identity-binding fields are
implemented.
Candidate HTTP endpoints are `POST /v1/memory/candidates`, `GET /v1/memory/candidates`,
`GET /v1/memory/candidates/export`,
`POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/cancel`, `POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/redact`, and
`POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/classify`, `POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/edit`, and
`POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/working`, `POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/retry`, and
`POST /v1/memory/candidates/{id}/consolidate`.
The working endpoint changes a pending proposal's retention tier before consolidation; it does not
silently reinterpret a durable proposal. Retry explicitly requeues the latest dead-lettered job
before attempting consolidation again. Owner-local operators can persistently pause or resume
all current and future queued work through `POST /v1/memory/consolidation/pause|resume`, and inspect
that durable gate through `GET /v1/memory/consolidation/status`; memory-scoped principals can read
the state, while only the owner can change it. Candidate list responses include the latest bounded
consolidation status, decision, classification, policy identity, attempts, canonical memory id, and
stored reason, explanation, supporting-memory ids, and failure metadata when a job exists. The review client may request up to the project-wide 1,000
candidate bound and applies validated `query` and `status` filters across that whole bound, rather
than only the newest page. Candidate review and export responses use
`{ "candidates": [...], "truncated": boolean }`; clients must narrow their filters or paginate at a
higher layer instead of presenting a truncated response as complete. CLI and MCP list/export
operations fail explicitly with narrowing guidance when the same row or byte bound is reached.
The CLI equivalent is
`cortana memory candidate propose|list|export|cancel|redact|classify|consolidate`. Candidate submissions require
an explicit JSON provenance object, source id, sensitivity, and expiry; content is limited to 8 KiB,
provenance to 4 KiB, and expiry to seven days. The bounded path rejects sensitive/restricted
proposals and never advances the canonical memory revision.

Cortana Desktop exposes this lifecycle in Settings under Native agentic memory. Pending, approved,
auto-retained, rejected, expired, failed, and dead-letter views are searchable and virtualized. Any
action that may write canonical memory requires explicit confirmation and is still revalidated by
the backend. Supersession requires an explicit, confirmed action, can replace only the canonical
memory selected by same-axis classification, and reports whether a canonical write actually
occurred. Automatic retention and recurring processing remain disabled; the Desktop does
not present schedule controls until an operational scheduler exists. Edit-and-approve first validates and atomically updates a pending candidate, cancelling
stale queued work before the versioned policy is evaluated again. Recallable canonical memories and
derived reflection projections are rendered in separate, labelled layers; derived data is never
presented as evidence or canonical memory.

## Operating boundaries

Memory is not an automatic mirror of ingestion. Source sync remains the
authority for world knowledge, while explicit memory writes are the authority
for agent conclusions. The store is local-first and protected by the operator's
filesystem policy, auditable, exportable through the scoped export and backup
paths, and bounded by content, provenance, ACL, and recall limits.

A retry with the same dedupe key and identical normalized payload is a true
no-op: it does not advance the memory revision, so answer-cache entries remain
reusable. `brain_status` reports active, expired, retracted, superseded, and
total records. Expired working memories remain exportable for audit and backup,
but are excluded from recall and active-capacity accounting.

Recall is deliberately local and bounded. SQLite FTS5 produces the candidate
set, then Cortana applies a stable salience score so a precise, recent memory
beats a weak one-term match even when the latter has a high importance value.
The score is returned as `relevance_score` for agent diagnostics; it is not a
confidence claim and does not override ACL, expiry, or lifecycle checks.

Dedupe keys and supersession targets are workspace-scoped: a memory in one project
cannot overwrite or supersede a memory in another project, including for the owner.
Retired records keep their dedupe keys reserved, so replacements use a new key and
cannot resurrect tombstones or create lifecycle cycles. This keeps work, personal,
and special operational context isolated even when agents reuse generic retry keys.

The supported product path keeps retention, deletion, ACL, and backup semantics
in one database and makes offline operation deterministic. Owner-local CLI
remember, recall, and forget commands also emit metadata-only audit events;
memory titles, content, queries, and identifiers never enter the audit trail.
