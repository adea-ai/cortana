# Operations

Operational trust boundaries and incident controls are defined in the [security and trust model](security-model.md).

The supported container/VPS profile, TLS boundary, durable volumes, capacity baseline, and
recovery drills are defined in [Self-hosted deployment](self-hosted.md). Local and self-hosted
profiles use the same single-node store and public provider contracts.

This guide defines the supported operational model for a local Cortana installation. It does not track current milestone status or open work.

Current operational tasks and blockers belong in [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/milestones) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/issues). Tagged operational evidence belongs in [Release history](releases.md).

## Operating model

The accepted primary deployment is one local user with:

- a Tauri Desktop application;
- a local Rust core and HTTP/MCP services;
- an optional local embedding service;
- a Python connector environment;
- a SQLite database in WAL mode;
- per-user service definitions;
- owner-private configuration, credential references, logs, and backups.

The safe installed state is query-only. Server and an optional embedding service may run, while source reads, ingestion, reconciliation, recurring synchronization, provider-backed synthesis, shared principals, restore, and memory writes remain explicit decisions.

## Data and configuration

Keep separate:

- application binaries and packaged resources;
- configuration;
- private environment or secure-storage records;
- SQLite data;
- backups;
- logs;
- service definitions;
- connector caches and temporary spools.

Use restrictive owner permissions. Reject unsafe symlinks and non-regular files where the contract requires them. Publish configuration, service files, and mutable state atomically under the appropriate lock.

Do not copy a live SQLite database as a substitute for the supported backup operation.

## Health and readiness

### Health

Health answers whether a process is alive. It must remain lightweight and must not perform full database integrity, source validation, or provider evaluation.

### Readiness

Readiness is a read-only operational gate. It verifies the configured subset of:

- configuration validity;
- database access and integrity;
- embedding/index fingerprint agreement;
- provider availability;
- API behavior;
- backup freshness and verification;
- source validation and schedule policy;
- query mode and optional grounded provider probe;
- packaged component/version agreement where available.

A readiness failure is a stop condition. It must not repair, migrate, ingest, reconcile, schedule, or delete implicitly.

Typical owner-local checks include:

```bash
cortana --version
cortana doctor
cortana readiness --max-backup-age-hours 48
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:7331/healthz
```

Use the exact supported flags from `cortana --help` for the installed version.

## Services

Cortana services are independent:

- core HTTP server;
- local embedding runtime;
- recurring source synchronization;
- backup scheduler.

The Desktop may inspect, install, start, stop, restart, or uninstall approved services without making the window the source of truth.

Operational requirements:

- actions are idempotent;
- data, configuration, credentials, logs, and backups survive ordinary service changes;
- failures name the affected service and provide remediation;
- stale PID or state files are handled safely;
- port conflicts fail visibly;
- start-all does not install or enable recurring synchronization;
- closing Desktop does not silently stop approved agent access;
- stopping a service is explicit and auditable.

## Source operations

Follow [Source rollout](source-rollout.md).

The operator sequence is:

1. configure one source;
2. authorize it;
3. select exact scope;
4. validate read-only;
5. run a bounded non-reconciling trial;
6. inspect progress, indexed evidence, citations, resource use, and backup state;
7. complete validation at the intended budget;
8. separately decide reconciliation and recurring policy.

Never use readiness flags as authorization shortcuts. A passing source gate does not itself permit a schedule or deletion.

## Query and provider operations

Core search and ContextBundle construction do not require a query model.

When changing an embedding provider or model:

- probe the proposed provider;
- compare the configured fingerprint with the active index;
- stage or explicitly migrate the embedding generation;
- rebuild atomically where required;
- retain rollback and backup;
- invalidate derived caches;
- do not treat a model dropdown change as sufficient.

When enabling planner or synthesis:

- use an approved provider and bounded request/response settings;
- run deterministic and approved-corpus evaluation;
- require citation validation;
- preserve extractive fallback;
- record privacy disclosure and opt-in;
- keep provider failure from blocking core retrieval.

## Principals and remote access

With no bearer principals configured, HTTP is loopback-only and uses the implicit local owner.

Shared or remote use requires:

- named principals;
- least-privilege scopes;
- explicit ACL labels;
- secret values stored outside TOML and renderer state;
- rotation and revocation;
- metadata-only audit;
- explicit non-loopback acknowledgement;
- an approved TLS/network boundary.

Scopes are conceptually separate:

- `query`;
- `status`;
- `memory`;
- `admin`.

Do not expose the owner-local CLI as a multi-tenant authorization surface. Shared agents use MCP with a scoped token or bearer-authenticated HTTP.

## Backups

Use the supported online SQLite snapshot operation. `cortana backup` creates a consistent snapshot
of the full database, including canonical records, memories, ACL and revision metadata, derived
indexes, and cache tables as stored at backup time. Configuration files and credentials held outside
SQLite are not included and must be preserved separately. The command runs SQLite's integrity check
but does not create a versioned archive envelope or embed an application/schema version.

A backup procedure must:

- keep snapshots in owner-restricted storage and record the creating Cortana release alongside
  each file, because the command does not embed that metadata;
- preserve the configuration and credential material needed to operate the restored installation
  through a separate owner-controlled backup process;
- verify any off-host copy independently before relying on it;
- retain enough history for rollback under the configured policy.

The command reports success only after its snapshot passes SQLite integrity verification. That check
confirms SQLite can read the database pages; it does not confirm that a particular Cortana release
can open the schema. Backup creation and compatibility with a restore target are separate checks.

## Restore

Restore is destructive and confirmation-gated.

Before restore:

- stop or quiesce mutating writers;
- run `cortana verify /path/to/snapshot.sqlite3` on the input;
- identify the Cortana release that created the snapshot and the release that will open it;
- check disk space and permissions;
- create a recovery copy of the active data;
- record the intended target and rollback path.

Backup files are plain SQLite databases. The current verifier checks SQLite integrity, and restore
copies the database into place; neither step negotiates application or schema versions. On the next
open, `Store::open` applies the schema additions and backfills implemented by that Cortana release.
There is no reverse-migration path or general forward/backward compatibility guarantee. Prefer the
release that created the snapshot. If you need to use another release, restore a copy into a separate
disposable data directory and confirm that it opens and passes readiness before replacing the
active data.

After restore:

- verify SQLite integrity;
- verify corpus and memory revisions;
- test scoped search and recall;
- verify ACL and principal behavior;
- inspect source and validation status;
- run readiness;
- retain audit evidence.

Restore rejects symlinked inputs and snapshots that fail SQLite integrity verification before
copying them. A structurally valid database that the target release cannot open may pass that
check, so compatibility must be checked with the target release against a disposable copy first.

## Updates

Desktop updates use signed updater artifacts. A supported update verifies:

- manifest and channel;
- archive safety;
- updater signature;
- checksums and package identity;
- nested binaries and platform signing where required;
- application/core/connector version agreement;
- preserved user data and policy;
- restart and service recovery.

Network, manifest, signature, disk, partial-download, or restart failure must leave the prior installation recoverable.

An update must not authorize a source, enable recurring synchronization, expose remote access, or enable synthesis automatically.

## Logs, metrics, and audit

Operational telemetry may include:

- process and service status;
- source and sync-run counts;
- progress and outcomes;
- cache statistics;
- memory lifecycle counts;
- provider degradation;
- latency and errors;
- backup and update state;
- package version.

Default audit and metrics must exclude:

- query text;
- source content;
- memory content;
- bearer values or hashes;
- provider keys;
- credential paths;
- local absolute paths.

Bound log size and retention. Scrub connector stdout/stderr and provider errors before persistence.

## Failure and recovery

General failure rules:

- operations have independent timeouts and resource limits;
- safe idempotent reads may retry with bounded backoff;
- authorization and policy failures fail fast;
- ambiguous destructive effects stop automatic retry;
- partial ingestion never gains reconciliation authority;
- cancellation stops future work and preserves a valid completed prefix;
- corrupt caches are evicted rather than making canonical retrieval fail;
- provider failure degrades explicitly;
- recovery never broadens scope or disables ACLs.

Use disposable drills and temporary indexes for destructive or adversarial validation whenever possible.

## Migration

Hermes or other legacy migration is recovery-first:

1. inventory legacy services, data, credentials, and skills;
2. create and verify Cortana and legacy rollback backups;
3. import or rebuild under explicit workspace and ACL mapping;
4. verify representative retrieval, memory, and recovery;
5. remove only approved obsolete active runtime components;
6. retain migration helpers and explicitly retained legacy data until separate deletion approval.

A successful migration command does not authorize deletion.

## Incident handling

For suspected corruption, credential exposure, unauthorized access, unsafe deletion, or updater compromise:

- stop the affected mutating operation;
- preserve logs and metadata without exposing content;
- revoke or rotate affected credentials;
- isolate remote access;
- create a verified recovery snapshot where safe;
- identify corpus, memory, source, and package revisions;
- open a security or incident issue through the approved private/public channel;
- do not reconcile or restore until the impact and rollback plan are understood.

## Evidence to retain

Operational evidence should include:

- version and platform;
- command or action class without secrets;
- scope and budgets;
- timestamps and outcome;
- revision or package identifiers;
- non-secret errors;
- backup/restore verification;
- reviewer and approval where required;
- linked issue.

## Planning boundary

This guide defines operations. [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/milestones) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/issues) own current operational work, rollout decisions, owners, blockers, and acceptance status.
