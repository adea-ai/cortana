# Cortana Desktop UX audit

This document defines the durable packaged-product acceptance contract for Cortana Desktop. It does not track current implementation status, open blockers, or release-specific pass/fail state.

Current Desktop work and evidence belong in [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/milestones) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/issues). Tagged release evidence belongs in [Release history](releases.md).

## Audit boundary

Source tests, web tests, Rust tests, static archive inspection, checksum verification, updater-signature verification, and packaged-core evaluation are necessary but do not prove the packaged GUI.

A supported Desktop claim requires a real package to complete the relevant native flows on the named operating system and architecture.

The manual `Desktop acceptance` workflow adds a narrower published-package host lane: it extracts
or selects the release application, starts it with disposable configuration and data directories,
and stops it after a bounded startup window on macOS Apple Silicon, Linux x86_64, and Windows
x86_64. This proves packaged process startup and isolated state setup only. It does not replace
interactive GUI, browser OAuth, tray/service, native-dialog, updater, accessibility, or
macOS Developer ID/notarization acceptance.

The workflow may verify a historical published tag from a newer verifier checkout. In that case
it explicitly allows source-version drift, records the requested release version in the component
version fields, and preserves the verifier checkout versions plus a drift marker in the evidence.
On Linux, the host-launch lane installs the packaged application's GTK/WebKit runtime dependencies
and runs the AppImage under Xvfb before checking for stable process startup.

The published-package control-plane lane runs against the same package targets. It uses isolated
temporary configuration and data directories to verify offline initialization, bounded fixture
ingestion, search, context retrieval, metadata-only audit export, backup, restore into a second
directory, rejection of an invalid restore snapshot with byte-for-byte active-index preservation,
integrity verification, and post-restore search. Its evidence records that external network
isolation was not asserted; it complements, but does not replace, the GUI and platform acceptance
lanes below.

The package verifier also checks the repository's Tauri updater binding: exactly one official HTTPS
`latest.json` endpoint, a non-empty verification public key, disabled automatic updater dialogs, and
enabled updater artifacts. This proves configuration and manifest binding only; signed download,
restart, rollback, and failure recovery still require the packaged updater lane.
The native updater flow also exposes an explicit cancellation action: cancellation interrupts an
in-progress download when possible, preserves the pending update for retry, reports a terminal
`cancelled` state, and never requests a restart.

The same workflow runs `scripts/desktop-service-status-acceptance.mjs` against each packaged core.
This read-only lane validates the complete five-service status schema and proves that the isolated
state root is unchanged; it never installs, starts, stops, restarts, or uninstalls a service. A
runner without a usable service manager is recorded as `supported: false`, not as successful
service operation. Service lifecycle, tray, autostart, crash recovery, and schedule installation
remain separate platform acceptance gates.

The same workflow runs `scripts/desktop-source-authorization-acceptance.mjs` against each packaged
core. This provider-free safety lane verifies that unknown sources, missing token destinations, and
malformed Google, GitHub, Discord, and Slack OAuth-client inputs fail closed before a provider flow
starts, and that the isolated state root remains unchanged. It is intentionally not evidence that a real provider
consent flow completed; successful OAuth, discovery, revocation, expiry, and denial recovery still
require operator-controlled packaged evidence. When an x86 package runs under Docker Desktop
emulation, the harness pre-creates and excludes only the known `.cache/rosetta` runtime cache from
its state snapshot; all other isolated configuration and data changes remain failures.

On Unix package targets, the acceptance workflow runs the extracted release archive's root
`install.sh` in a disposable prefix. On Windows it runs the published MSI silently with restart
suppression, then uninstalls it. These installer lanes verify clean file placement, installed
version and web assets, the packaged core, explicit connector installation where applicable,
query-only defaults, absence of source or service-schedule side effects, and an offline packaged-core
evaluation. They do not substitute for interactive first-run UI, authorization, services, tray
behavior, updater lifecycle, recovery, accessibility, or operating-system trust.

On macOS, the workflow also requires a supplemental native lifecycle record for the exact
packaged application. The harness resolves a nested `Contents/MacOS/cortana-desktop` path back to its
`.app` bundle and launches it through LaunchServices so the check exercises the packaged application
boundary. It checks the status-item menu, close-to-tray, and tray reopen behavior in an isolated user
state. This lane is required by the aggregate package matrix but remains supplemental to the
host-launch and renderer lanes; it does not expose embedded webview controls. Native dialogs, OAuth,
autostart, service installation, updater installation, screen readers, and OS trust remain separate
acceptance gates.
If the host's Accessibility tree cannot expose the window, the report also records a bounded
CoreGraphics screen-window diagnostic; that diagnostic can explain the observation boundary but does
not turn the close-to-tray or tray-reopen cases into a pass.

## Product principles

- Desktop is the primary human surface, not the canonical database or background-service authority.
- The Rust/Tauri process is the privileged boundary.
- The renderer receives no arbitrary shell, filesystem, credential, backend-address, updater, or service-manager capability.
- Ordinary knowledge, memory, graph, query, and status reads use the authorized local API.
- Privileged operations use typed, allowlisted native commands with argument validation, confirmation where required, atomic writes, and metadata-only audit.
- Closing the window does not silently stop approved background agent access.
- Source authorization, validation, ingestion, reconciliation, scheduling, restore, and update are separate user decisions.

## Acceptance matrix

### Installation and first launch

Verify:

- correct package and architecture selection;
- clean installation and launch;
- application, core, connector, web asset, and package version agreement;
- sidecar and local-runtime discovery;
- optional tooling detection;
- approval-gated tooling installation;
- progress, cancellation, retry, and remediation;
- healthy query-only startup;
- no implicit source authorization, model download, ingestion, schedule, shared principal, or memory write.

Evidence should include the exact package identity, operating system, architecture, application version, and outcome.

### Workspace management

Verify:

- create, rename, switch, and remove workspaces;
- stable generated internal identifiers;
- display name, icon, color, and theme behavior;
- account labels as optional metadata rather than credential authority;
- workspace-specific source assignment;
- no “all workspaces” retrieval path that bypasses isolation;
- state persistence across navigation, refresh, window close, and process restart.

Workspace selection is UX, not authorization. Backend project and ACL checks remain authoritative.

### Source setup and authorization

Verify supported provider-native flows:

- Google browser OAuth and callback;
- GitHub device flow;
- Apple Notes host permission and exact folder routing;
- filesystem/code directory selection;
- Discord Desktop RPC;
- Slack browser OAuth and team/channel assignment;
- Buzz identity/community discovery;
- write-only token or API-key fields.

For each source verify:

- enable/disable only from the source-management model;
- selected workspace and ACL;
- bounded discovery;
- read-only validation;
- visible budgets and write impact;
- explicit initial-sync confirmation;
- progress, cancellation, retry, and recovery;
- no secret returned to the renderer or logs.

Authorization and discovery must not imply validation or synchronization.

### Knowledge browser

Verify:

- workspace and source navigation;
- source/document hierarchy;
- keyset-paginated and virtualized lists;
- exact canonical document view;
- source identity, URI, update time, workspace, ACL context, and metadata;
- backlinks and nearby records;
- integrated scoped search and cited answers;
- result-gated answer, evidence, and timeline views;
- direct links to original sources;
- loading, empty, partial, degraded, offline, revoked, and error states;
- safe rendering of Markdown, HTML-derived content, code, and malformed records.

Previews and derived summaries never replace exact canonical content.

### Graph exploration

Verify:

- bounded initial page;
- progressive node expansion;
- keyset pagination and load-more behavior;
- node and edge type filters;
- local search and focus;
- selected-node relationship explanation;
- provenance and confidence for derived edges;
- navigation to supporting documents, memories, and code;
- cancellation and renderer-memory cleanup;
- full-width graph mode and restoration of the prior workspace layout;
- no unbounded full-corpus load or traversal.

Graph traversal must not expand ACL visibility.

### Native memory

Verify:

- explicit retain/remember, recall, supersede, expiry, export, and forget;
- content type and retention-tier presentation;
- project and ACL scope;
- provenance, confidence, importance, and lifecycle status;
- evidence/memory distinction in answers and ContextBundles;
- tombstone and redaction behavior;
- no automatic source-to-memory copying;
- candidate, consolidation, contradiction, and reflection UX only when the corresponding backend policy is explicitly enabled.
- searchable, virtualized candidate queues for pending, approved, auto-retained, rejected, expired,
  failed, and dead-letter states, with bulk actions capped at 25 records;
- explicit confirmation for canonical promotion, including edit-and-approve, keep-working,
  supersede, and retry actions;
- owner-only persisted pause/resume controls plus bounded retention ceilings, candidate review
  expiry, and active-memory capacity; recurring processing and automatic retention remain disabled
  until an operational scheduler and release gate ship;
- visible provenance, support, classification, policy identity, confidence, sensitivity, expiry,
  attempts, and failure state sufficient to explain why a record exists or was superseded;
- keyboard-operable native controls, announced errors/status changes, responsive layouts, and
  usable large-queue behavior at 200% zoom.

Derived observations or reflection output must not be displayed as canonical memory or source evidence.

### Settings and secrets

Verify:

- complete non-secret configuration coverage;
- local and cloud embedding selection;
- optional query-provider configuration;
- provider-advertised model discovery with custom fallback;
- staleness invalidation when endpoint, mode, or key reference changes;
- write-only secret fields;
- explicit migration to macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service;
- rollback and redacted recovery when native credential storage is unavailable;
- import/export with redaction;
- generation-aware embedding changes;
- automatic restart of only the affected services;
- visible rollback and remediation on failure.

Secret values must not appear in renderer state, configuration exports, audit, crash reports, or logs.

### Services, tray, and background behavior

Verify:

- install, start, stop, restart, inspect, and uninstall per-user services;
- guarded Start All, Stop All, and Restart All;
- recurring synchronization excluded from generic service activation;
- close-to-tray, reopen, explicit quit, and stop-services choice;
- menu-bar status and single-instance behavior;
- login autostart;
- service crash, stale state, port conflict, sleep/wake, logout/login, and restart recovery;
- bounded durable activity for running, completed, failed, and cancelled service actions;
- retry and recovery after timeout, late completion, or a concurrent-action rejection;
- MCP and HTTP availability while the window is closed;
- status derived from durable operational state rather than renderer assumptions.

### Backup, restore, import, and export

Verify native dialogs and privileged file operations for:

- source path selection;
- settings import/export;
- memory export;
- audit export;
- backup destination;
- restore input.

Verify:

- online SQLite snapshot creation;
- independent backup verification;
- explicit restore confirmation;
- recovery copy of replaced data;
- corrupt, incompatible, symlinked, inaccessible, and low-disk failure paths;
- post-restore evidence, memory, ACL, revision, source, and readiness checks;
- rollback instructions.

### Updater

Verify:

- update discovery;
- current and available version;
- release notes and source link;
- explicit approval;
- download progress and cancellation;
- signature and manifest validation;
- archive safety;
- package/core/sidecar version agreement;
- restart and service recovery;
- preserved configuration, index, memory, credentials, backups, and policy;
- network, signature, manifest, disk, partial-download, and interrupted-restart failures;
- upgrade and documented rollback from a supported prior version.

An update must not enable a source, schedule, remote principal, or synthesis policy.

### Visual system and responsive layout

Verify:

- the checked-in shadcn configuration, selected primitive base, icon library, aliases, and Tailwind entrypoint agree with the generated components;
- shared shadcn primitives own ordinary actions, forms, cards, navigation, overlays, menus, status, loading, empty, and error states;
- renderer-specific graph, virtualization, and native-window components compose the shared tokens and controls without recreating parallel primitives;
- every supported theme uses the same semantic token contract and preserves readable hierarchy, contrast, focus, status, and destructive treatments;
- the shell, setup, sources, workspace, search, document, context, graph, memory, services, settings, backup, updater, activity, and recovery surfaces form one coherent visual language;
- phone, tablet, compact desktop, and wide desktop layouts remain usable at 320, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS pixels;
- content remains operable at 200% zoom without clipped controls, hidden actions, overlapping regions, or two-dimensional scrolling except where the content itself requires it;
- loading, empty, partial, degraded, offline, busy, success, warning, destructive, and error states retain stable layout and clear recovery actions;
- dialogs, sheets, dropdowns, popovers, tooltips, command surfaces, and native-dialog launch points have correct placement, stacking, focus entry, focus return, and dismissal behavior;
- no ordinary surface retains superseded page-local button, form, card, tab, menu, tooltip, dialog, or status styling, and no control falls back to browser-native chrome.

Capture matched before/after screenshots using deterministic fixtures for every primary surface.
The evidence matrix must include all four target widths, the default and accessibility themes at
every width, every other supported theme at desktop and compact widths, representative populated
data, and all loading, empty, error, destructive-confirmation, dialog, sheet, menu, and tooltip
states. A build, component test, or sampled screenshot is not visual acceptance. Review must record
the complete matrix and any intentional renderer-specific exception.

### Accessibility

Verify:

- full keyboard operation;
- visible focus and focus restoration;
- screen-reader names and roles;
- heading and landmark hierarchy;
- alert versus status semantics;
- WCAG 2.2 AA text, non-text, and focus contrast;
- zoom and responsive resizing;
- reduced-motion behavior;
- tooltip accessibility;
- disabled and busy states;
- error recovery without pointer-only interaction;
- minimum 24-by-24 CSS-pixel targets and comfortable touch targets for primary mobile actions;
- no keyboard trap or focused control obscured by sticky or layered content;
- automated axe coverage plus manual VoiceOver, NVDA, or platform-equivalent screen-reader evidence on supported packaged lanes.

Accessibility is a release requirement, not optional polish.

For deterministic knowledge-browser and graph regression coverage, run:

```bash
bun run test:knowledge-accessibility
```

The `Knowledge accessibility` pull-request workflow builds `apps/web/dist`, runs the command against
the production Vite preview in Chromium, and uploads a bounded JSON report plus responsive document,
graph, and large-corpus screenshots. The gate exercises keyboard entry and graph selection, canonical
document/provenance views, WCAG 2.2 AA axe rules, accessible graph-filter names, live selection
status, reduced motion, 200% reflow, 320/390/768/1024/1440 layouts, clean console behavior, and a
provider-free 2,500-document fixture with bounded document and graph pagination. It also records
request, response, DOM, visible-node, heap, and interaction timing observations against explicit
renderer ceilings. It contains no private source content. It complements the published package
host-launch and control-plane lanes; a passing renderer report is not evidence that VoiceOver, NVDA,
native dialogs, browser OAuth, tray behavior, updater behavior, or operating-system trust passed in a
signed package.
The runner waits for two browser animation frames after each viewport change so responsive assertions
and screenshots use settled media-query geometry.

The same acceptance script can validate an immutable published renderer by setting
`CORTANA_KNOWLEDGE_WEB_DIR` to the extracted package's `share/cortana/web` directory and recording
the release tag in `CORTANA_KNOWLEDGE_REVISION`. The published-package workflow does this on each
supported target and sets `CORTANA_KNOWLEDGE_RUN_LARGE=false` for the current `v0.56.15` release,
whose bundle predates the large fixture. The current source/preview lane records the bounded
large-corpus screenshots and resource observations; a future published bundle that contains the
fixture may enable it in the package lane. Its report and screenshots are uploaded with the package evidence; any responsive or
accessibility failure remains a packaged-release failure until a new release is built and checked.

For local package regressions built from the current worktree, set
`CORTANA_ACCEPTANCE_PROVENANCE=prospective-source` along with the target and evidence-directory
variables. This preserves the distinction between current-source reports and immutable published
release reports; the published CI workflow explicitly labels its immutable bundle as
`published-package-renderer`.

### Security

Verify:

- fixed Tauri capabilities and CSP;
- renderer compromise boundaries;
- no arbitrary shell or filesystem access;
- no secret or private path disclosure;
- path and symlink defenses;
- owner-only files;
- atomic configuration publication;
- metadata-only audit;
- prompt injection treated as untrusted document content;
- account switching and revocation;
- remote bind safeguards;
- update and supply-chain verification.

### Resource and large-corpus behavior

Measure:

- startup and first-ready latency;
- idle and active CPU;
- renderer and native memory;
- source/document list rendering;
- graph open and expansion;
- request count and response bytes;
- database latency;
- cancellation cleanup;
- background-service overhead;
- behavior under slow storage and low-memory conditions.

No primary view may load the full corpus or graph into memory.

## Evidence record

Each packaged acceptance record should include:

- release/tag and package checksum;
- operating system and architecture;
- installation type;
- application/core/connector versions;
- exact acceptance cases run;
- pass/fail/blocked result;
- the complete non-secret visual evidence matrix for renderer changes;
- non-secret logs or recordings where useful;
- known limitations;
- linked issues for failures;
- reviewer and date.

Do not put credentials, source content, private queries, tokens, or local absolute paths in the record.

## Planning boundary

This audit defines what must be tested. [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/milestones) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/issues) own which cases are pending, who owns them, their sequence, blockers, and current evidence.
