# Release history

Cortana preserves published tags and corrects release metadata with a new patch
release instead of rewriting an existing tag.

The transitional `v0.1.2` release shipped the production installer and platform
archives while the Rust version update was being migrated from the legacy
single-package flow. The following patch release reconciles the Release Please
manifest, Rust crate, Python package, web application, and lockfile versions
under the automated manifest flow.

## Current release: v0.56.13

Download the Desktop app or a matching core archive from the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/releases/latest). The protected
`v0.56.3` tag was the last fully-evidenced source and release boundary when this matrix was captured. It includes the M10 knowledge graph,
large-corpus, Desktop, accessibility, and derived-vault implementation from
[PR #2231](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/pull/2231), followed by the protected patch releases
`v0.56.1` through `v0.56.3`. The current release is `v0.56.13`.

The v0.56.3 release-assets workflow
[`33732982983`](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/actions/runs/33732982983) built and uploaded
the Linux, macOS ARM64, and Windows Desktop packages, both core archives, and the updater manifest.
Its final cross-platform verifier passed, and the strict local verifier confirmed all 18 expected
`v0.56.3` assets and updater signatures, including the fixed-feed Tauri updater configuration
binding. The v0.56.3 published package-acceptance workflow
[`33777924364`](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/actions/runs/33777924364) passed on macOS
ARM64, Linux x64, and Windows x64, covering package download/extraction, version checks, offline
core acceptance, and isolated Desktop host startup. Its historical Knowledge accessibility workflow
[`33778045953`](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/actions/runs/33778045953) also passed the
limited provider-free Chromium, axe, keyboard, reduced-motion, zoom, and mobile renderer gate.
An exact published-bundle rerun of the expanded packaged renderer acceptance found that the
immutable v0.56.3 web bundle fails at 320 CSS pixels: the graph's “Filter graph minimum confidence”
control is obscured by another graph control. The current source branch contains the responsive
layout fix, but v0.56.3 remains a partial packaged-renderer result until a new release is built and
verified. The current acceptance runner also waits for settled browser layout after responsive
viewport changes, preventing stale media-query geometry from producing a false overlap result in the
prospective source workflow.

The acceptance verifier now also runs the Unix release archive installer in a disposable prefix and
requires those reports in the strict macOS/Linux matrix. The exact published v0.56.3 arm64 package,
archive installer, packaged control plane, host launch, and supplemental native lifecycle records are
captured under the local exact-release evidence matrix. The historical v0.56.3 workflow artifacts
predate these lanes and must be regenerated from a rerun before the cross-platform matrix can be
considered current.

The shipped v0.56.3 core passed the provider-free M10 knowledge evaluator against 25 workspaces,
100 sources, and 2,500 documents/chunks: all operation p95, response, index, RSS, working-set,
relationship, ACL, and invalidation thresholds passed. This is synthetic evidence; the report
still records `approved_corpus_gate: not-run` and visual usability as a separate packaged gate.

The macOS package uses the explicitly enabled ad-hoc recovery path because Apple Developer ID and
notarization credentials are not configured in Actions. It is a valid downloadable package but is
not evidence of trusted Gatekeeper distribution. Native GUI behavior, OAuth, tray/background
services, native dialogs, updater interaction, manual assistive-technology review, resource
behavior, uninstall, and manual recovery remain OS-specific acceptance gates.

The deterministic memory evaluation and disposable control-plane, native-memory, and backup/restore
drills passed locally; the control-plane report now also proves that a rejected corrupt restore leaves
the active index unchanged, and the shipped Unix recovery drill checks the same invariant in its
disposable restore target. These checks use synthetic or disposable fixtures and do not authorize
sources, recurring sync, automatic retention, or access to an approved production corpus.

The governed-corpus gate remains intentionally open. The evaluation contract and template manifest
are documented in [evaluation.md](evaluation.md), but the template is not an approved corpus and
the final gate requires an authorized operator-owned, read-only manifest and index with provenance.
No private or personal index was promoted to satisfy this requirement. Manual evidence must be
recorded with package checksum, exact case results, OS/architecture, reviewer/date, and limitations
using the matrix in [desktop-ux-audit.md](desktop-ux-audit.md). The sanitized record format and
fail-closed verifier are documented in [evaluation.md](evaluation.md); the checked-in template is
intentionally not an acceptance result.

The approved relationship-quality gate is open for the same reason. The provider-free graph
correctness report passed, but no governed relationship corpus or control-versus-graph user-task
record has been promoted. Its transport-safe external-evidence template and verifier are documented
in [evaluation.md](evaluation.md); graph activation and optional inferred edges remain separately
gated.

### v0.34.43 post-release reconciliation incident (historical)

The release publication itself succeeded. The subsequent Code Foundry run
[`32774655565`](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/actions/runs/32774655565) failed only in its
post-release reconciliation job: it classified old `staging` history as unpromoted, attempted to
replay commit `9a5b3a7`, and encountered broad conflicts. The published tag and 18 verified assets
remain valid, but the retained branch history is not a clean starting point for another development
cycle. Issue [#2099](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/issues/2099) was closed after PR #2100
proved the exact-tree state, removed the obsolete staging ref/ruleset, and passed a clean Code
Foundry reconciliation run. No force push or automatic conflict resolution was used.

## v0.34.40 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.40 metadata release carried forward the verified v0.34.39 runtime evidence. Its package,
host, and synthetic evaluation claims are historical; at that time, the source and package claims
belonged to v0.34.44, while the latest installed-host evidence was v0.34.42.

## v0.34.39 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.39 metadata release carried forward the verified v0.34.38 runtime evidence. Its package
and host claims are historical; at that time, the source and package claims belonged to v0.34.44,
while the latest installed-host evidence was v0.34.42.

## v0.34.38 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.38 metadata release carried the control-plane readiness hardening from PR #1954 and
its verified runtime, source-validation, and synthetic provider evidence. Its package and host
claims are historical; at that time, the source and package claims belonged to v0.34.44, while the
latest installed-host evidence was v0.34.42.

## v0.34.37 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.37 metadata release carried forward the verified v0.34.36 runtime evidence. Its package
and host claims are historical; at that time, the source and package claims belonged to v0.34.44,
while the latest installed-host evidence was v0.34.42.

## v0.34.36 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.36 metadata release carried forward the verified v0.34.34 runtime evidence and the
protected UI action-button hardening from PR #1864. Its package verification and host evidence are
historical; at that time, the source and package claims belonged to v0.34.44, while the latest
installed-host evidence was v0.34.42.

## v0.34.29 release intent (published and verified; historical)

The post-v0.34.28 source carries the shell action-button hardening from PR #1864. Rail navigation,
titlebar actions, search-history controls, and source-header actions now use the shared token-backed
icon-button primitive, with regression coverage for the standardized controls. This release intent
changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or native-memory
policy. The release-assets workflow and packaged-core verifier are complete. Native Desktop
acceptance, host installation, source production-budget validation, provider-corpus evaluation, and
macOS Developer ID/notarization remain separate gates.

## v0.34.21 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.21 release was a metadata-only follow-up to the verified v0.34.20 runtime. Its
18-asset release workflow `32605080974` and strict package verifiers passed; the installed host
passed query-only readiness, deterministic evaluation, and the disposable memory/shared-agent/
control-plane drills. These records remain valid evidence for the metadata-equivalent v0.34.22.

## v0.34.20 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.20 release published the UI consistency and release-metadata follow-up to the verified
v0.34.19 runtime. Release-assets workflow [`32603677864`](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/actions/runs/32603677864)
verified all 18 assets, checksums, updater signatures, manifest, and packaged core. The installed
host was upgraded from v0.34.19 and passed readiness, native-memory, shared-agent, MCP, and
control-plane drills. Its bounded Apple Notes validation and trial evidence remains historical
evidence for the metadata-equivalent v0.34.21 release.

The installed `cortana eval --model` fixture passed planner and synthesis execution, citations,
cache reuse, and revision invalidation in 12,827 ms without provider fallback. This is synthetic
fixture evidence. A bounded live approved-index evaluation still found recall 1.0 but MRR 0.25,
and a synthesis-enabled attempt timed out; extractive mode remains the safe production default.
The packaged GUI, browser OAuth, tray, native dialogs, updater interaction, Developer ID signing,
notarization, full-budget source validation, and recurring sync remain separate gates.

## v0.34.17 release notes (historical)

The v0.34.17 runtime release promoted the exact staging tree through protected promotion PR #1745
and the version-only Release Please PR #1746. Release-assets workflow `32593385885` completed
the strict archive, checksum, updater-signature, manifest, and packaged-core verification gate;
all 18 published assets were verified. The installed host passed readiness, native-memory,
shared-agent, MCP, and control-plane drills. The approved-corpus provider gate remained open,
and extractive mode remained the safe production default.

## v0.34.10 release notes (historical)

Download the Desktop app or a matching core archive from the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/adea-ai/cortana/releases/latest). The protected
`v0.34.10` was the protected source and published release at the time. Release-assets workflow
`32544658079` completed the archive, checksum, updater-signature, manifest, and credential-free
packaged-core gates; all 18 published assets are verified. v0.34.8 and earlier remain
historical evidence.

### Supported Desktop platforms

The v0.34.10 Desktop support policy is **macOS Apple Silicon (arm64), Linux x86_64, and Windows
x86_64**. The release intentionally does not publish an Intel macOS Desktop bundle, so Intel
macOS is unsupported rather than merely unverified. Rosetta execution and the macOS core archive
do not change that policy. Adding Intel support requires a matching app bundle, strict codesign,
updater signature, installer verification, and native Desktop acceptance evidence.

For a first installation, use the Desktop-first steps in the [README](../README.md#desktop-first-launch-recommended).
The app starts query-only: source authorization, validation, initial sync, local model setup, and
recurring ingestion are separate confirmation-gated actions. macOS Developer ID/notarization and
real browser, tray, native-dialog, and updater interactions remain host acceptance gates; passing
the release verifier does not claim those GUI behaviors.

To re-check the published release without touching the live index or starting a sync:

```bash
GH_REPO=adea-ai/cortana CORTANA_REQUIRE_MINISIGN=1 \
  scripts/verify-desktop-release.sh v0.34.10
```

The current-release section is the operational source of truth. Entries below preserve historical
release and incident evidence and should be labeled historical when a newer patch is published.

The v0.34.10 source was the release boundary for native agentic memory and the post-v0.31.12
hardening, bounded live-index evaluation harness, and readiness-budget diagnostics described below.
Future source-tree changes
must still use the protected staging and promotion flow, followed by the release verifier, before
being called downloadable-release behavior.

The historical source gate was also explicit. On 2026-08-22, 13 sources were enabled and the installed
v0.34.10 CLI refreshed all of them at the safe 25-document/5 MiB/60-second validation bound. Ten
have fresh `complete=true` bounded records; the three Special Google sources failed closed because
their shared OAuth grant returned `invalid_grant`. Personal Drive passed the bounded probe after
explicit reauthorization, but its prior 2,000-document/128 MiB/900-second run was operator-
cancelled after 147 documents while serialized PDF body fetching stalled; no index or
reconciliation writes occurred. The protected v0.34.10 release includes bounded parallel body
fetching from PR #1594 and the evaluator and Desktop cold-start hardening. None of these refreshed
records proves the configured production budgets, so `readiness --allow-sync-service` remains
closed and recurring sync remains uninstalled; no reconciliation or large sync has been started.

The repository also includes `scripts/shared-agent-auth-drill.sh`, a disposable offline HTTP smoke
check for scoped principals, ACL isolation, metadata-only audit responses, and token rotation. It
uses synthetic data only and is not a substitute for the packaged GUI/MCP/manual acceptance gates.
The companion `scripts/shared-agent-mcp-drill.py` exercises the real shipped MCP stdio subprocess,
including workspace ACL filtering, file-backed token rotation, and revocation. Both drills are
offline synthetic evidence and never authorize a source or touch the live index.

### v0.34.10 release intent (published and verified; historical)

The v0.34.10 package was the protected version-only Release Please follow-up to exact-tree
promotion PR #1693 and staging reconcile PR #1696. It publishes the selective shared-button UI
increment from PR #1678 without changing credentials, source authorization, indexed data,
recurring-sync policy, or native-memory behavior. Release-assets workflow `32544658079` completed
all 18 platform assets, checksums, updater signatures, manifest, and packaged-core verification.
The installed CLI was upgraded to v0.34.10; query-only readiness and the bounded provider-backed
fixture evaluation remain separate evidence from the still-open packaged-GUI, source,
provider-corpus, and macOS trust gates.

## v0.34.8 release intent (published and verified; historical)

The v0.34.8 package published the validated Drive PDF extraction hardening from PR #1673 and the
current staging metadata reconciliation from PR #1677. Its strict release-assets and packaged-core
verification passed before the v0.34.9 UI promotion; the installed v0.34.8 runtime remains
historical evidence only.

## v0.34.6 release intent (published and verified; historical)

The v0.34.6 package publishes the validated staging tree after the exact-tree protected promotion
PR #1664. It is a version-only release over the v0.34.5 runtime boundary: no credentials, source
authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or native-memory policy changed. Release-assets
workflow `32531597016` completed all 18 platform assets, checksums, updater signatures, manifest,
and packaged-core verification. The installed CLI was upgraded to v0.34.6; query-only readiness,
native-memory/security/recovery drills, and the bounded provider-backed fixture evaluation remain
separate evidence from the still-open packaged-GUI, source, provider-corpus, and macOS trust gates.

## v0.34.5 release intent (published and verified; historical)

The post-v0.34.4 source adds a dependency-free, theme-token-backed Button primitive for the
React/Vite renderer. Error recovery and key Settings actions now use shared primary, secondary,
compact, ghost, and icon variants, preventing browser-default controls from reappearing while
preserving the existing Tauri renderer and custom token system. This is a selective shadcn-style
adoption; Cortana does not add Tailwind, Radix, or a second design system.

The protected staging-to-main promotion, version-only Release Please PR, release-assets workflow
`32528987169`, all 18 assets, updater signatures, manifest, and packaged-core verifier are complete.
This release changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or
native-memory policy. Native Desktop GUI/OAuth/tray/dialog/updater acceptance, host installation,
and macOS Developer ID/notarization remain separate gates.

## v0.34.3 release intent (published and verified)

The post-v0.34.2 source tree standardizes the remaining compact Desktop action controls across
source configuration, validation, readiness, and installer surfaces. The controls now share the
existing tokenized button contract, keyboard focus behavior, disabled states, and error/status
semantics instead of falling back to browser-default grey buttons. The Desktop architecture guide
also records a selective shadcn/ui adoption policy: future primitives may be copied only when a
concrete accessibility or consistency gap exists, mapped to Cortana tokens, without introducing a
parallel Tailwind/Radix design system.

This release changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or
native-memory policy. The protected staging-to-main promotion, version-only Release Please PR,
release-assets workflow `32516622075`, all 18 assets, and packaged-core verifier are complete.
Native Desktop GUI/OAuth/tray/dialog/updater acceptance and macOS Developer ID/notarization remain
separate host gates.

Because the protected promotion flattens staging history, its promotion commit preserved the
`Release-As: 0.34.3` footer explicitly and used a conventional `fix(release):` subject, allowing
Release Please to discover and merge the version-only PR.

## v0.34.4 release intent (published and verified)

The post-v0.34.3 source tree adds two operational hardening fixes: approved-corpus answer
evaluation now enforces the requested source scope against every returned citation, and Desktop
service start/restart commands allow the configured five-minute cold-start budget instead of
failing after one minute. The protected staging and main promotions, version-only Release Please
PR, release-assets workflow `32525494727`, and strict 18-asset verifier are complete.

This release intent changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync
state, or native-memory policy. Native Desktop GUI/OAuth/tray/dialog/updater acceptance and macOS
Developer ID/notarization remain separate host gates.

## v0.34.2 release intent (published and verified)

The v0.34.2 release publishes the protected Drive validation improvement and the current
production-ready release boundary. The bounded four-worker Drive body-fetch pool from PR #1594 is
included in the protected source and installed runtime. The release changes no credentials, source
authorization, indexed data, or recurring-sync state; Personal Drive remains below its full-budget
validation gate and recurring sync remains uninstalled.

The protected exact-tree promotion, version-only Release Please PR, release-assets workflow
`32500872377`, all 18 assets, updater signatures, manifest, and packaged-core verifier completed.
Native Desktop GUI/OAuth/tray/dialog/updater acceptance and macOS Developer ID/notarization remain
separate host gates.

## v0.34.1 release intent (published and verified)

The Apple Notes permissions handoff is the user-facing change in this release. The protected
promotion and version-only Release Please PR are complete.

The post-v0.34.0 source tree adds a first-class Apple Notes permissions handoff in Desktop. The
source editor now exposes **Grant Apple Notes access**, opening the macOS Automation privacy pane,
and the getting-started and ingestion guides document the exact folder-to-workspace setup. The
handoff fails closed on unsupported platforms and does not read, authorize, or sync Notes by itself.

This published release restores the already-validated Apple Notes `fix(desktop)` change
to Release Please's conventional-commit history after the protected exact-tree promotion flattened
its topic commit. It changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync
state, or Hermes data. The protected promotion, version-only Release Please PR, release-assets
workflow, signatures, and packaged-core verifier have completed; v0.34.1 is the downloadable
Apple Notes permissions release.

## v0.34.0 release intent (published and verified)

The post-v0.33.0 source tree improves the canonical native memory layer with local salience-aware
recall ranking. Candidate memories are scored by query-term coverage using the same token-prefix
semantics as FTS, lexical relevance, confidence, importance, freshness, and exact-versus-fallback
matching. The score is bounded and diagnostic; ACL, expiry, supersession, dedupe, and cache
invalidation contracts remain unchanged.

This release intent changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, or recurring-sync
state. Native memory is the only supported operational-memory path. The protected promotion,
version-only Release Please PR, and release-assets workflow have completed; the `v0.34.0` package
is the downloadable native-memory release.

## v0.33.0 release intent (published and verified)

The post-v0.32.12 source tree makes native agentic memory part of Cortana's canonical SQLite
knowledge store. It adds explicit `remember`, `recall`, `forget`, `context`, and bounded `export`
operations with workspace isolation, ACL enforcement, provenance, idempotent dedupe, supersession,
expiry, redaction tombstones, cache-revision invalidation, and metadata-only audit events. Native
memory is the only supported operational-memory path for this release intent.

This release intent changes no source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or live
credentials. The protected promotion, version-only Release Please PR, and release-assets workflow
have completed; the v0.33.0 package is the downloadable native-memory release. The published
package does not imply source authorization, recurring sync, or live memory writes.

## v0.32.12 release intent (published and verified)

This patch publishes the Drive connector hardening promoted through the protected staging-to-main
flow: bounded PDF/DOCX extraction, folder and folder-shortcut filtering, metadata-only records for
unsupported binary items, and correct placement of the `--max-documents` cap. The release intent
changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or native
memory state. The exact-tree promotion and Release Please version PR have merged, and
the `v0.32.12` tag is published. Release-assets workflow `31933279147` completed the package
verification gate with all 18 assets, checksums, updater signatures, manifest, and packaged-core
checks.

## v0.32.11 release intent (published and verified)

This patch promotes the current-release documentation boundary after the v0.32.10 package was
published. Release-assets workflow `31928018360` completed all 18 assets and the strict verifier;
it changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or native
memory state.

## v0.32.10 release intent (published and verified)

The post-v0.32.9 source tree contains the bounded Google Drive PDF metadata preflight and the
corresponding current Personal Drive validation evidence. This release intent keeps those
production-safety changes represented by a downloadable patch release after the protected
staging-to-main promotion and Release Please version PR. It changes no credentials,
source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or native memory state.

The protected promotion and version-only PR merged successfully. Release-assets workflow
`31926397636` published all 18 assets and passed the strict cross-platform verifier, including
archive checksums, updater signatures, the manifest, and packaged-core verification.

## v0.32.9 release intent (published and verified)

This patch publishes the bounded large-PDF Drive parser after the v0.32.8 production-budget
validation timed out while reading a large document. PDFs larger than the bounded page window are
sampled with an explicit truncation marker instead of holding the connector indefinitely. Release
Please published the v0.32.9 tag, and release-assets workflow `31920097809` completed all 18 assets,
checksums, updater signatures, the manifest, and packaged-core evaluation. The release changes no
credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync state, or native memory state.

## v0.32.8 release intent (published and verified)

This patch records the rollback-safe Hermes migration publication and the protected promotion that
reconciled the staging and main trees. Release Please published the v0.32.8 tag, and release-assets
workflow `31903165576` completed all 18 assets, checksums, updater signatures, the manifest, and
packaged-core evaluation. The migration stages outputs before publication and restores prior
files on failure; it changes no credentials, source authorization, indexed data, recurring-sync
state, or native memory state.

The v0.32.7 release intent below remains the preceding published evidence record.

## v0.32.6 release intent (published)

This metadata-only intent publishes the readiness-budget diagnostics that landed after v0.32.5.
Readiness failures now report the validated and required document, byte, and duration limits so
operators can correct an under-budget source without inspecting private validation-state files.
The intent changes no credentials, indexed data, source authorization, recurring-sync state, or
native memory state. The protected promotion carrying this tree included
`Release-As: 0.32.6`; Release Please opened and merged the version-only PR, and the tag is now
published. The release-assets workflow `31880502344` and strict 18-asset verifier completed
successfully, including all platform archives, checksums, updater signatures, the manifest, and
packaged-core offline evaluation.

## v0.32.5 release intent

The graph workspace/source focus fix and its evidence-selection regression coverage are now
promoted through the protected staging-to-main flow. This metadata-only release intent asked
Release Please to publish the patch so the fix is represented by a downloadable version;
it does not authorize source credentials, a corpus sync, reconciliation, or implicit memory
writes. Its release-assets workflow and strict 18-asset verifier succeeded before this section
was promoted as the current release record.
The protected promotion commit carries the explicit `Release-As: 0.32.5` footer so the
main release caller preserves this intent after the staging history is flattened.

The protected promotion `#1301` and Release Please automation published v0.32.5 from the
v0.32.4 documentation and graph-focus promotion. Release-assets workflow `31872008773` completed all platform
jobs and the strict 18-asset verifier, including archive checksums, six updater signatures, the
updater manifest, and the credential-free packaged-core offline evaluator. These checks do not prove packaged GUI
behavior, operating-system signing, full-corpus source readiness, or live personal-memory
behavior.

The previous v0.31.15 package and workflow `31774425020` remain historical evidence.

The v0.32.0 package also includes the bounded, read-only live-index evaluation harness
(`scripts/evaluate-live-index.py` and `eval/live-manifest.example.json`). It measures retrieval
recall/MRR, citation validity, bounded provider-backed synthesis, fallback behavior, latency, and
repeated-query cache hits against an operator-approved corpus without syncing, reconciling,
changing the index, or printing query content. A private manifest and successful run are still
required before claiming the approved-corpus evaluation gate is closed.

## v0.32.2 source hardening and rollout evidence

The v0.32.2 release contains the embedding-supervisor recovery fix: after three consecutive
five-second health-probe failures, the supervisor stops and respawns the local embedding child
and waits for health before continuing. The fix keeps steady-state liveness checks lightweight
while preserving a real vector probe for startup and restart.

The 2026-08-15 operator rollout added production-budget validation evidence without enabling
recurring sync or reconciliation. Work Drive validated 478 documents and 4,527,663 bytes at the
2,000-document/128 MiB/900-second budget. Work Gmail validated 7,395 documents and 34,494,647
bytes at its 10,000-document/64 MiB/600-second budget. A Work Drive non-reconciling trial was
intentionally cancelled twice under the installed v0.32.1 binary after its embedding service
stalled; it made no deletions and did not authorize a full index. After v0.32.2 installation, a
foreground retry progressed through bounded unchanged batches before the local embedding health
probe timed out behind queued Qwen work; it was cancelled after roughly seven minutes, and the
service recovered afterward. It made no deletions and remains pending a longer bounded trial. The Personal Drive production validation then failed closed at its
899-second connector timeout; it produced no validation record and did not authorize a sync.
Special Gmail completed production-budget validation with 214 documents and 995,335 bytes and a
bounded 100-document-cap non-reconciling trial with 0 deletions. Personal Gmail completed
production-budget validation with 430 documents and 1,563,456 bytes and the same bounded
100-document-cap non-reconciling trial with 0 deletions. These capped prefixes remain short of
complete production trials.

On 2026-08-15 a second bounded Work Drive retry emitted all 478 connector records but failed closed
when the local embedding connection closed during ingestion. The run used `--no-reconcile`, made no
deletions, and the supervisor restarted the router; query-only readiness passed after recovery.
Because controlled ingestion commits completed prefixes, this is not a clean trial result. Work
Drive remains pending a successful bounded retry.

These records advance source readiness but do not close the recurring-sync gate: every enabled
source still needs a fresh complete production-budget validation and a successful bounded trial.
Discord and code/filesystem sources remain disabled by operator choice, Slack remains optional and
unconfigured, and native memory remains explicit-write only.

## v0.31.16 release-history recovery

The graph hierarchy, truthful status fallback, and Desktop-first project documentation were
validated on `staging` and promoted to `main` through the protected exact-tree flow. This
metadata-only marker restores those already-published changes to Release Please's conventional
commit history after the promotion was flattened; it does not change runtime behavior, authorize
sources, enable recurring sync, alter credentials, or trigger a memory write. The v0.31.16
version PR, published assets, and strict 18-asset verifier have completed successfully.

Generated version pull requests are restricted to changelog and configured
version files, then merged automatically without running the code-change test
matrix. Topic pull requests target the protected `main` branch and squash after
the required validation gates. Release Please version PRs also target `main`
and rebase through the protected release contract.

## Direct-main invariant

The repository uses Code Foundry's `direct` workflow. Topic branches start from
`main` and merge there with squash after the required validation gates. Release
Please version PRs also target `main` and rebase through the protected release
contract.

The release caller (`release.yml`) triggers only on pushes to `main` and
delegates the Release Please contract to the pinned Code Foundry runtime. The
normal direct workflow requires no staging promotion caller or branch reconciliation. A retained
legacy branch must not be treated as an active integration lane or replayed into `main` without an
explicit evidence-backed migration.

The `uv.lock` project entry carries a Release Please version annotation and is
covered by the package-version regression test, keeping Python lock metadata
aligned with the shared release manifest after an automated release.

The merge methods are intentionally distinct: topic PRs squash into `main`,
while Release Please version PRs rebase into `main`. This keeps the protected
release branch linear without a second integration branch.

## 0.19.0 release-history recovery

The native memory settings, deterministic evaluation gate, and bounded store
telemetry landed together in the 2026-08-02 promotion. A metadata-only marker
commit restores those already-published capabilities to Release Please's
conventional-commit history after that promotion was merged as one squash commit;
it does not change runtime behavior or trigger a corpus sync.

## 0.23.0 release-history recovery

The agent integration guide, model-backed evaluation opt-in, nested filesystem
coverage, and numbered local setup path landed together in the 2026-08-03
promotion. This metadata-only marker restores those already-published staging
capabilities to Release Please's conventional-commit history after the
promotion was merged as one squash commit. It changes documentation only; it
does not alter runtime behavior, credentials, or trigger a corpus sync.

## 0.30.7 release-history recovery

The planner headroom fix and current provider-backed evaluation evidence landed
in the 2026-08-11 staging promotion. This metadata-only marker restores those
already-published staging capabilities to Release Please's conventional-commit
history after the promotion was flattened into a single tree commit. It changes
documentation only; it does not alter runtime behavior, credentials, or trigger
a corpus sync.

## Post-v0.31.11 production hardening

The source tree after the published `v0.31.11` tag includes production hardening
that is carried by the next patch release: provider and Desktop loopback
clients reject redirects, the required unit gate runs both Bun and Python tests,
retired model identifiers are guarded in shipped runtime paths, and packaged-core
offline evaluation is enforced by the release verifiers. This marker restores
those changes to Release Please's conventional-commit history after the protected
promotion flattened their source commits. It changes release metadata only; it
does not alter runtime behavior, credentials, or trigger a corpus sync.

The next release verification must include the packaged-core offline evaluator in
addition to archive, checksum, updater-signature, and manifest checks.

The v0.31.12 patch release carries this verification contract; it does not alter
runtime behavior, credentials, or indexed data.

The release signal is intentionally documentation-only so Release Please can
publish the verification contract without changing the runtime or indexed data.

This marker is the v0.31.12 release boundary for the protected promotion flow.

## v0.31.13 onboarding and auth hardening (historical release contents)

The protected promotion after `v0.31.12`, released as `v0.31.13`, carries the Desktop-first getting-started guide,
documentation synchronization rules, and atomic HTTP bearer-policy reload with fail-closed
remote-listener protection. This metadata-only marker restores those already-validated staging
capabilities to Release Please's conventional-commit history after exact-tree promotion flattened
their topic commits. It changes release metadata only; it does not authorize sources, enable
recurring sync, alter credentials, or change indexed data.

The v0.31.13 release verification retained the archive, checksum, updater-signature, manifest,
and packaged-core gates from v0.31.12. The HTTP reload behavior is covered by rotation, invalid-policy,
remote-listener, and metadata-only audit tests; source-tree MCP bearer sessions reread the file-backed
policy on each tool call and fail closed on malformed or revoked credentials.

The post-release source also serializes direct JSONL ingestion and source validation with the
global `sync.lock`, and requires a bearer principal for `/readyz` on remote listeners while keeping
`/healthz` public liveness. These changes are not retroactively claimed for the v0.31.12 artifact.

Bearer-policy reloads now prefer the private `0600` environment file for HTTP and file-backed MCP
principals, while connector and provider API-key lookups retain process-environment precedence.
Process-environment-only bearer clients remain startup-scoped and must reconnect after rotation.
The macOS package verifier also rejects malformed `CORTANA_REQUIRE_GATEKEEPER` values instead of
silently treating them as an optional check; only `0` or `1` is accepted.

The same source-tree lane now also:

- acquires the mutation lock before opening the store for mutating CLI commands, so startup
  migrations and fingerprint writes cannot race a concurrent sync;
- bounds direct JSONL imports to 2,000 documents, 128 MiB of content, 15 minutes, and 8 MiB per
  line, and bounds custom evaluation fixtures before deserialization;
- fences native memory writes and redactions to explicit record identities; and
- serializes Desktop resource preparation and atomically renames completed resources into place.
- serializes Desktop settings and schedule writes through one per-config cross-process lock.

These are shipped safety contracts, not evidence that a large personal sync or implicit memory
write is enabled. The v0.32.0 package, signatures, and packaged-core gate are verified; the
manual Desktop and source-authorization gates remain separate.

## Desktop release gates

The desktop pipeline follows a protected two-lane policy:

- **Staging PRs run the required fast aggregate.** `desktop.yml` listens to `staging` so the
  protected branch always receives the stable `Tauri 2 / Linux` result. Its job-level guards skip
  the long Linux audit jobs on staging; this keeps staging suitable for rapid integration while
  still failing closed if the aggregate itself is cancelled or fails.

- **Main PRs run the desktop aggregate.** `desktop.yml` exposes the stable
  `Tauri 2 / Linux` aggregate for main-targeted pull requests. Its six
  independent jobs provide the final desktop audit before merge.
- **Main code PRs require the desktop aggregate.** Ordinary main-targeted code
  pull requests run six independent jobs: `gtk_provenance`, `gtk_iterator`,
  `security_audit` (pinned Rust dependency audit), `desktop_test`,
  `desktop_clippy`, and `release` (Linux release compilation). The stable
  `Tauri 2 / Linux` aggregate depends on all six and must pass before merge.
  Provenance, the iterator test, dependency auditing, desktop tests, and
  clippy run concurrently so no independent check waits behind another.
- **Release Please PRs stay lightweight.** Version-only release PRs skip the
  expensive desktop jobs; manual workflow dispatch remains available for a
  full audit, while release-assets performs the published-package audit.
- **Repository quality is owned by Code Foundry Validation / CI.** The
  `desktop_test` and `desktop_clippy` jobs do not rerun the root `type-check` or
  `build` scripts: Code Foundry Validation / CI already runs the Python, Rust,
  and web checks on the same PR SHA, so the desktop pipeline only
  runs desktop-specific fast checks.
- **Version-only release PRs are intentionally lightweight.** Release Please
  pull requests (`release-please--branches--main` head refs) skip all six long
  desktop jobs entirely at job level. The `Tauri 2 / Linux` aggregate still
  runs and treats skipped dependencies as acceptable, so the required check
  stays green without burning runner minutes on version bumps.
- **Manual workflow dispatch is the final audit path.** Dispatching
  `desktop.yml` on any branch reruns all six jobs unconditionally, independent
  of pull request state.
- **Audit tooling is warm-cached.** The `security_audit` job caches the exact
  `cargo-audit` 0.22.2 binary in
  `~/.cargo/bin` under a stable per-OS/arch key, so repeated final audits
  restore the pinned binary and skip `cargo install`; on a cache miss the
  install stays locked to 0.22.2, and the audit itself still fails on any
  vulnerability.

The aggregate fails on any dependency failure or cancellation rather than
silently skipping, so a real regression can never hide behind the release-please
fast path.

Desktop artifacts also carry the connector package source as a Tauri resource. The
application never embeds credentials or a machine-specific virtual environment; after an
explicit Readiness approval, native Rust uses the local `uv` executable to create the per-user
connector environment and install the bounded ingestion extra.

The published-package acceptance workflow also runs
`scripts/desktop-control-plane-acceptance.mjs` on each supported target. This disposable,
provider-free lane verifies packaged-core initialization, bounded ingestion and retrieval,
metadata-only audit export, verified backup, restore into a second isolated data directory,
integrity verification, and post-restore search. It also runs a read-only packaged service-status
probe that validates all five managed-service records without requesting lifecycle mutation.
`--offline` prevents provider-backed work in the
plan; it does not create an OS-level network sandbox, so the report explicitly records that network
isolation was not asserted. The workflow's aggregate matrix job fails closed unless exactly one
passing `published-package-control-plane`, `published-package-service-status`,
`published-package-source-authorization`, package, and host-launch report exists for each supported
target. The source-authorization lane rejects
unknown sources, missing token destinations, and malformed provider OAuth-client inputs without
starting a provider flow or changing isolated state; it does not replace successful OAuth, discovery, or the separate GUI,
native-dialog, service/tray, updater, accessibility, recovery-UI, uninstall, or operating-system
trust gates.

## Binary archive verification

Before uploading a binary archive, the release workflow runs
`scripts/verify-release.sh`. It checks the SHA-256 sidecar, rejects absolute or
path-traversal entries, requires the executable, web workspace, connector wheel,
example config, and Cortana skill, and executes the packaged binary's version
command — asserting the reported version equals the release tag encoded in the
archive name (`cortana-vX.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz`). An archive whose name does not
embed a plain semver version, or whose packaged `bin/cortana` reports a
different version, fails the gate so a stale-checkout build or mislabeled
upload can never ship as a release. The final published-asset gate
(`scripts/verify-desktop-release.sh`) repeats the version and, for releases built
after this gate was introduced, offline-evaluation assertions on the downloaded
Linux core archive when running on Linux. When the host can execute the packaged
target, the current verifiers run `cortana --offline eval` with an isolated
temporary configuration and a hard 60-second timeout, requiring JSON `passed: true`.
The macOS package verifier applies the same check to the bundled core. These checks
prove the shipped core only; they do not launch the GUI or authorize sync. To verify
a downloaded archive locally:

```bash
./scripts/verify-release.sh \
  cortana-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz \
  cortana-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.sha256
```
